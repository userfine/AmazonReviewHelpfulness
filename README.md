# Proposal

## Abstract
It is quite convenient for people to shop online, e.g. on Amazon, however, the quality of the product can not be ensured for the fact that only textual descriptions and photos are accessible to customers, leaving checking the product themselves impossible. Fortunately with the help of other customers' reviews, especially those which could give practical and helpful advice, customers are able to identify the average quality of the product by and large. That being said does not mean all reviews are helpful to perspective customers, it is therefore important to know how to identify helpful reviews and write meaningful reviews. We will present a feasible model to predict the helpfulness, i.e. like and dislike counts, based on the text content of a review on Amazon website. Various features will be investigated, such as part-of-speech words, sentiment and others. We will select some important ones among the comprehensive feature list and build a precise model upon them, hoping to achieve the best accuracy with least dimensions.


## Data descriptions
Raw review data is 20GB, consisting of 142.8 million reviews. Our main dataset will be the product review data, after removing duplicate items, is 18GB. 24 categories of products, from books to personal care, are available in the dataset.

## Deliverables
1. Report of our findings, presenting a comprehensive list of features related to the helpfulness of a review, and a model to predict the helpfulness of a recently composed review.
2. A pipeline/some scripts to generate the exact results as stated in our report.
3. **anything else?**
