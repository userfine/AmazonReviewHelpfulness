Getting this, most popular&lt; Spanish newspaper on my Kindle before it hits the newsstands in Spain, was a fantastic opportunity for me to keep in touch. It's easy for other reviewers to say that the paper copy is better, but in the place where I live in the US hoping to find a copy of ""El Pais"" on the newsstand is ridiculous.After being subscribed to ""El Pais"" on my Kindle for a few months, I have cancelled all my subscription to the US newspapers. ""El Pais"" is a great place to find honest, well-written, engaged reporting about events in the US, Europe, and the entire Spanish speaking world. If I want to find some unbiased and well-researched articles about what is going on in the US, ""El Pais"" is the best place to go.One of the great things about this newspaper is that, unlike in the US where journalists seem to be nearly illiterate, the people who write for the Spanish paper have a really good writing style. Also, you can find articles by the leading Spanish-language novelists in almost every issue of ""El Pais."" Juan Goytisolo, Vargas Llosa, Almudena Grandes, Elvira Lindo, and many others write for ""El Pais"" on a regular basis.De veras es el mejor periodico que he leido jamas en mi vida.

It's easy to read on the no-backlight Kindle screen.  The organization of the paper is pretty good.But the Globe's Kindle edition needs much improvement.  It's almost like getting the newspaper in paperback book form, and nobody has the time to read or even skim through 700 pages every day.  You can jump around with headlines, but often they aren't descriptive enough.  Daily columnists are never identified, so you have to guess which headline takes you to Joan Vennochi or Bob Ryan.Why would you pay for the electronic edition instead of reading the free website?  For me, it's to get the Globe's presentation of everything it has to offer.  The front page has important news at a glance, but you also see features and photos you might never read except for their placement.  You can tell quickly what stories are most important, and read a few sentences or half the story.  On a newspaper website, I get lost in clicks and side stories, and after a half dozen stories I can hardly find your way back to the beginning.  I never spend as much quality time with [...] as I do with the paper.  The Kindle edition needs to do more to provide the reading advantages that are worth paying for.The Newsstand electronic edition gives me the navigation and appearance of the printed paper.  I can read it anywhere I go without all the trash, and it's cheaper than the printed paper too.  The Kindle edition was fun to try and easier on the eyes, but after a long trial I preferred the other system.

I've long since stopped reading the Globe, as it's news and editorial emphasis is too liberal for me.That being said, I decided to try the Kindle edition for the two week trial, largely to get some local news coverage.  (The Boston Herald, a slightly more conservative competitor isn't available for the Kindle.)The Globe's Kindle edition was decent.  I still hate the slant of the paper, but having local news was convenient.But, bias aside, it would be MUCH better if it includes small ""blurbs"" for all of the articles, not merely some.  Approximately 60% of the stories are only listed by their headlines.  Often it was impossible to know what the article was about, and I found myself having to open an article, and often reverse my path if I didn't want to read it.  More details in the article listings would have helped.In sum, if you like the NYTimes little Bostonian brother for news, the Globe's Kindle edition is ok.  But, if you don't need local news, there really isn't much reason to subscribe.Give the trial a shot, though.  No harm to try.

I subscribed the first day I found out about it and have not been disappointed. I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess). Some pictures are now beginning to appear too. The ads are gone (so unless you only buy the paper for the ads - some people do - you will be pleased). The Contents, Sections and Next Article layout is great. From the main page you can just skim all the headlines by hitting the next page button until you get to the end - and then you'll know you haven't missed any of today's headlines. If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there). The only thing that's missing is the comics and the death notices but you can read those on-line at the comic sites in the first case and the Globe's site in the case of death notices - if you really, really want to.Good job.",412,A32Q5HN7RQN6GL,Finally!

Poor editing procedures.Articles sometimes have programming codes left in them during the conversion process, again poor editing.Boston Globe team can be late in delivering the Kindle edition (really, how hard can it be to deliver ONE computer file on time?)Unusable web-links are sprinkled throughout articles.  They do nothing but distract the reader.  Probably residue left by the poor conversion and editing process.You can't easily jump back an article if you inadvertently click past one. You have to either click back page-at-a-time (slow) or jump articles starting back from the section beginning (again slow).

This is a pain if Amazon's electronic delivery fails for the Boston Globe (happened to me once) and you need them to resend.Hard to believe, but the Boston Globe's customer service department is unaware that they publish a kindle edition!  Don't call them with delivery failures--they're completely clueless.A recent change in the Kindle's format now has articles ending and beginning on same page rather than beginning on their own page as they did before. This makes navigation worse as it sometimes separates articles from their navigation links. Bad decision.Price is too high at $9.99/month considering you're not getting everything the paper edition offers made worse by poor editing.

I subscribed not only because it is the regional paper, but also because this represented a cost savings over other papers such as the NYT. I have enjoyed it and consider the $9.99 to be well spent. But the Globe for Kindle will now jump to $14.99/month. A 50% price increase for *anything* is customer-unfriendly, but especially for the Globe Kindle version: on the Kindle, you do not get certain content such as comics, classifieds, or even the majority of photos in the paper. It is extremely unwise for the Globe to effect this sort of price hike without beefing up the Kindle content for the newspaper -- at the very least, the comics, which most people enjoy reading daily. Because of the new disparity between price and content, I will be canceling my subscription when my 6-month grace period under the old price expires.

They only store 8 days of past history for these subscriptions and everything prior to that time is LOST.This is a SERIOUS deficiency in Amazon's support. I understand the need to protect the publishers copyright, however, Amazon could provide a means for users to upload their subscription library back to an Amazon utility, then have Amazon decrypt and re-encrypt their library keyed to their new hardware. Such would be the logical, and responsible, policy. As it stands I am going to have to spend the time to replace my defective display screen, from the replacement unit sent, and send back the replacement device with my original and defective screen. However, if my loss of pixels (the reason for my warranty replacement) turns out to be caused by a defect in a circuit board on the unit, rather than the display itself, I would be hosed... Or, moreover, if the unit had been utterly destroyed, even if I had backed up the data, it would be useless, encrypted, noise...Be aware, before you shell out money for subscriptions to these newspapers, that the marvelously rich research library that you are accumulating over time, is exceedingly fragile and ephemeral....",250,A3H2SN0L5SMWO7,Loss of your Newspaper Subscription Library should Kindle fail -- DRM and Encryption,13,3.0,253,76.73,37.58,65.06,7.50,36.14,24.51,81.82,51.78,12.65,8.30,5.53,0.00,0.79,0.00,1.98,4.35,7.51,14.23,8.30,3.95,7.11,0.00,13.83,5.14,1.58,0.40,0.79,0.40,6.32,2.37,3.95,0.00,0.40,1.58,4.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.70,2.37,0.79,3.95,1.58,0.40,3.16,2.77,1.98,0.40,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.35,0.00,1.19,2.37,0.40,1.19,3.95,9.09,1.19,16.21,3.56,3.95,9.09,4.35,0.00,0.00,1.98,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.79,6.32,9.09,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,1.19,0.79,0.00
B001BAJA9K,Kindle Store,"[40, 40]",3.0,1.0,3.912621359223301,5.0,"(updated on 7/28/2012) I have been a subscriber to the paper edition of the FT for a few years now, and I have been reading it on kindle for more than a year. I love it! So far I can see (almost) only advantages:1. it is much less expensive. I used to have a discounted academic US subscription, but now apparently it is no longer available. The regular subscription is now ~350/year, while the kindle edition is 15/month = 180/year. Obviously much better.2. I have the smallish Kindle keyboard 3G, but reading and navigation are just great. In particular, it is really easy to navigate. You just press the 5-way button once to reach the compact table of content. Just right or left-press it to move to the next-previous article. It is actually way easier that using the newspaper with all those big pages, especially when you are in a constricted space like a plane of a crowded subway.3. The graphs and photos ARE there. Some users complained about their absence, but that was perhaps in earlier editions. I am not sure ALL of them are on the kindle editions, but I haven't missed any I care about so far.4. The web links also appear to work, in contrast to what other comments say. They are not ideal (you have to open the experimental browser to follow the link, obviously) but on the other hand you certainly could not follow a web link from the paper edition, could you?5. You can store past issues without the need of any physical space. Keep in mind that old issues are, by default, deleted from your kindle after 10 days or so.6. You do not need to get out of the house at 7AM at sub-freezing temperatures to pick up your copy! Last night I could not sleep and I downloaded the FT around 4AM, awesome!7. It is more environmentally friendly, because paperless!8. You never miss a copy because (as it happened once in a while in my case) your local delivery service happens to skip a delivery.9. You can have your copy even if you travel, no more need to suspend delivery. Even if you travel outside the US, as long as you have access to the web, you can download the copy on hard drive and then transfer it (free of charge) on your kindle, via USB. Just keep in mind that you do end up paying extra fees (about 5 dollars/week) if you want the newspaper to be delivered directly to your kindle WITH 3G AND you are outside of the US. Delivery remains FREE if you have access to Wi-fi. Of course, you need to keep in mind that, if you travel to a different time zone, you may not get the FT in early morning. Still, in Europe (6 hours ahead of EST) I am always able to download my FT at 7-8AM, and in Australia/Asia around 10AM!One of the few drawbacks I can think of is that if you live in a place where pickpocketing/theft are common, then you will have to be more careful when you commute, because no one will want to steal your paper copy of the FT, but many would like to steal your kindle. This may be paranoid, but I do live in a place where theft is a problem.Other minor quibbles:- sometimes a few characters in titles appear all scrambled and unreadable. This is VERY rare, however. It mostly happen with book titles in the Saturday's edition of the FT.- as far as I know (but please correct me if I am wrong!) you cannot save individual articles in a nicely formatted way. When you ""clip the article"", the article is added to a single file which on my kindle appears as un-formatted (e.g. no pictures, no bold characters for titles etc.). I presume you can still convert this file into other formats amenable to formatting, but that would be a drag. It would be nice if Amazon/FT found a way to retain and store individual articles in a way that preserves all the formatting, perhaps even allowing for a date index.Anyway, after more than a year of daily use, in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia, I can only say that I very highly recommend the FT for kindle. It's one of those (perhaps little) things that makes you think how much technology can make your life easier.UPDATE, April 2014: Until a few months ago you could only see the newspaper in the old B&W; kindle. Now you can also see it in android tablet. I own a Nexus 7 (2nd generation) and it works perfectly, with color pictures and all. The only option that does not seem to exist on tablet is ""clip article"", so it looks like you cannot save articles as ASCII files as you can with the kindle B&W.; At least I have not been able to do it but if you know otherwise please correct me.",831,A1PY6SJT8UHL92,I love it!

It gives you the headline, by line, and a word count (very useful) before the article. At the bottom of the page, it always tells you the headline of the next article, in case you want to skip ahead. If you press the 5-way button right, you can skip to the next article, left to skip back. Pressing the button in brings you to a list of the sections of the paper with the number of articles in each section next to it. You can jump to the front of that section or click on the number to go to a page that shows the headline and first few words of each article in the section, with about 5 of those to a page.

Even though Kindle does support jpegs and could handle far more graphical content that is supplied with other magazines and newspaper Kindle subscriptions, this isn't as problematic with the Nation as it, say, with the New York Times, where very few pictures or charts are included with articles, even in cases where the articles make reference to charts that aren't produced.Further, the price is right here.

You don't get the breathless ""breaking news"" type of reporting (a la Wolf Blitzer) in The Nation, which I find refreshing, but the issues are current and usually of considerable importance. The editors have time to be editors and the writers have time to do their homework. It's a more measured, intelligent approach to the world than we've gotten used to with cable news and screaming-head blogs.I do not find The Nation to be all that left-wing. On the contrary, I find a balance of perspectives from left (mostly left-of-center) to center-right. Importantly, there are no ""Screaming of the Extremists"" portions. There are well-articulated viewpoints and the occasional intelligent debate.

B004ZFZ4O8,Kindle Store,"[18, 18]",3.0,1.0,3.6923076923076925,5.0,"On newsstands and on Kindle, there are 3 major magazines devoted to short works (from short stories to novellas) in science fiction: ""Analog Science Fiction and Fact"", ""Asimov's"" and ""The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction"" (F&SF; here I mean the Extended version on Kindle - the free edition just contains the non-fiction parts of the magazine and is more or less a teaser for the Extended version).First a side note: I like reading science fiction, and now I live in Germany. Before Amazon existed, I had to buy lots of books on visits to America and take them over to Europe in my suitcase. First Amazon made it possible to order US books from Germany without huge (actually, usually free) shipping costs. Now, Amazon's Kindle makes it possible for me to read US magazines at what is actually *below* the price of a US newsstand or subscription price. Yay!I have an issue of F&SF; from 2010 that lists the 2-year subscription price as $56, plus $12 per year foreign postage, makes $80. The current Kindle subscription rate is $2 per issue. With 6 issues per year, that's only $24 for 2 years. Analog and Asimov's are about $33 per year, but have more pages.So, what's the difference between the three? Analog and Asimov's (both published by Dell Magazines) tend to publish science fiction that involves spaceships, aliens, robots and the like. F&SF; prints stories that are more literary, sort of like a normal short story with an element of science fiction / fantasy (sometimes described as ""New Wave"" science fiction to distinguish it from the subject matter of the ""pulps"" from the mid 20th century).Actually, I like ""spaceship"" science fiction, but I subscribe to F&SF; and only purchase Asimov's if that month's issue sounds promising. Why? I think the quality of the writing in F&SF; is a cut above that of the other two. But if you don't like fantasy-related stories at all, you would be better off choosing Asimov's.Analog has a reputation of having the most science-based SF stories, even including a ""Brass Tacks"" section where readers can discuss what they think are factual errors that appeared in the stories (or in the one-per-issue science fact article). Unfortunately, errors are what distinguish Analog from the other two - it is the only magazine of the top 3 that has abysmal copy editing, so that a missing word, or repeated words, or incorrect words appear about once per printed page (perhaps about what you'd expect from a webzine, but certainly not from a professional publication). There are also some factual errors that seem to indicate that the editors don't bother to read the manuscripts. In the issue I just read (July 2012), a story by a quite famous writer, Ben Bova (who usually writes very well), describes a golf hole that is par 6, but all 3 main characters manage to hit their balls onto or past the green on the first shot. I don't play golf, but I know that it will take 2-3 strokes to get onto the green on a par 5 hole, so it would be even more for par 6. Strange that nobody at Analog noticed this. (By the way, I also read some issues of Analog about 10 years ago, but they were so chock full of grammar and storyline mistakes back then that they were nearly unreadable. So nothing has changed there.)If you want to read stories with spaceships, etc., I think you should try Asimov's. If you like more down-to-earth stories and don't mind a little fantasy, go for F&SF;, which you should also do if you like high-quality writing and editing. But if you want to prove your skills as a copy editor, or if mistake-riddled writing doesn't faze you, then Analog is just the ticket for you!",638,A33Q32BD2TTEF8,"The ""Big 3"" science fiction magazines",6,3.3333333333333335,658,77.60,45.17,28.71,54.38,29.91,21.43,76.60,47.87,10.18,5.32,2.28,0.46,1.82,0.00,0.76,4.86,7.60,13.37,5.93,5.78,7.60,1.37,12.16,4.10,2.43,1.37,4.26,2.13,3.95,2.74,1.22,0.00,0.30,0.15,5.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.61,1.52,0.91,2.43,4.71,1.37,5.17,0.91,0.61,0.15,0.15,0.30,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,3.65,0.46,1.22,1.52,0.76,0.00,1.37,8.66,0.76,11.09,0.61,6.38,4.10,5.02,2.43,0.00,1.22,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,23.25,3.80,5.62,0.30,0.91,0.30,0.30,1.98,2.13,2.58,3.04,2.28

This is going to be a dissenting review, always its own punishment, but I hope it will help some of you readers to make a choice you'll be happy with.I've noticed a distinct trend of late; one we'll the ""Over-priced-Underwhelming-Kindle-Accessory"" trend. Like several items I own made specifically for the Kindle, the Tribeca Performance Headphones are basically decent and inoffensive in themselves, but in my estimation are worth about 1/6th the current asking price. Here is a breakdown:APPEARANCE: This is the biggest caution for you shoppers out there: These headphones do not really match their picture. They are mostly plastic and chintzy-looking in real life, with nowhere near the lovely deep mahogany hue you see in the photo.WEAR: The headphones are very comfortable; their best aspect really. And like pretty much all cup designs, they have some noise-canceling ability. The outside of the ear cup slipped off as I was listening to music and was very hard to get back on.SOUND/USE: The headphones worked on my Kindle and my laptop, but not my MP3 player, if you're wondering about the range of use. The sound is perfectly fine, about equal to my other pair of earphones, which I bought for $15. I am not an audiophile or expert in any way, this is only an ordinary person's perspective. I listen mostly to music on my Kindle, and there was no discernible difference, to me, in sound quality between these and my older and much cheaper headphones.So there you have it. A decent if flimsy-looking product, very much over-priced. They certainly won't win you any style points. I held them up to my sister without giving her any information and asked how much she would pay for them.

I have it on the Kindle now with no bubbles or creases, almost as if there's nothing on the screen. Here are some installation steps that you might find helpful:- Don't use the cloth that comes with the set, it only adds more lint. Use a glass cleaner (like Windex) and paper towels (e.g. Bounty) instead.- Turn screen off and place it under a bright light so that you can see any particles on the screen clearly.- Fold paper towel 3-4 times to make it thick. Gently spray Windex on the paper towel (it should be wet, not soaked) and wipe the screen. The screen should dry within a few seconds after it is wiped down. See that you don't see any particles on the screen now.- Peel off first outer layer of screen protector (keep screen protector close to the screen so that it doesn't pick up lint along the way). Handle film from the edges to avoid smudging.- Align screen protector on screen, make sure all edges are in line. Gently place screen protector down, make sure alignment is good, and press down with your fingers.- Now use the included application card to press out any bubbles. It is better to remove them now while the outer protective layer is still on the actual screen protector. The screen protector remains scratch free this way.- Remove the second outer layer. Press out any remaining bubbles with your thumbs or fingers.If you see any tint or oily reflection, you can clean with Windex again, this will go away within a few days of use. There are two screen protectors in the pack so there is some room for error. I have screen protectors on all my devices and prefer to have one spare for future use.

The covers are basically the same on the books as well so I thought that maybe it was just her trademark thing or something but boy o boy was I wrong. Every page in that book was identical to the pages in this book and the only difference was the author changed the names from Laura to Nora and from Logan to Hunter and some she even kept the same. Her books are amazing so don't get me wrong but I think this is a really cheap thing to do. I already paid for all of these books and if I wouldn't have realized it I would have paid double which isn't fair. I guess one thing that makes it okay to her is the fact that her dream realm trilogy Is no longer in the kindle store because I couldn't find it anymore..at least I still have my copies though. People shouldn't do this to make extra money and play us for stupid basically. I don't know if that was her intentions but it really upset me when I noticed that this was what happened. Just because you changed the name of the book and the names of the characters doesn't mean it's a whole new book.With all of this being said... if you don't own the dream realm trilogy and you never read it then I would recommend the books cause they really were amazing but I thought people should know that it is a copy of her first novels and she only changed the names of the characters and the title of the book.  This is why I am giving it a one star because I already have the original copy I have it a five star when I read it and I don't agree with authors that plagiarize their own work to make more money of their readers, is not fair to us. If your not happy with the price of your books than change it but don't change the book title and names of its characters so u can pass it off for a new book and make more money!!! Sophia you were a great author so please make new book to read and don't copy your books again, it really upset me and I an sure it would upset about if it happened to them. If you ask want proof let me know bc I can loan you the title dream realm trilogy to see for yourself that both stories are identical besides names of characters and title of book and series. I hope this helps you ask our if you have her dream realm trilogy please don't get this series it will be a waste money because you would already have the series like I do.

What at first seems like a slow start is actually a slow burn that bursts into flame at the end. If you've ever doubted whether your life is full, or your love is true, or worried about death or the claims the past makes upon the present, you'll be intrigued by Joyce's treatment of these themes.You will probably want to ignore the annotations on a first read, though. One is actually a partial spoiler for the ending, which I think is a terrible practice. If you are a tourist in Dublin, you will enjoy knowing just where everything takes place--and with these annotations, you will--but for anyone else, it is frustrating to follow a footnote only to find out on what corner of Dublin an aforementioned statue sits. Similarly, for antique furniture enthusiasts, it may be interesting to find out, in two separate footnotes, that peirglasses and cheval glasses are both different kinds of mirrors, but is it worth interrupting the narrative? Of the hundred or so footnotes, only a handful provide useful information for a non-specialist, and even these can be inferred from context. The only one that might be hard to guess is that ""delicate,"" in a certain context, means stricken with consumption, which we call tuberculosis--so now that I've given you that one, you can ignore the rest until your second, more scholarly reading.",243,A26BJVBNQYLGBX,"Wonderful and accessible Joyce, pedantic annotations",6,5.0,248,64.44,70.01,60.40,64.00,31.00,21.37,86.29,56.45,13.71,5.65,0.81,0.40,4.44,0.00,0.00,8.06,8.87,13.31,10.48,6.05,7.26,0.00,17.34,4.84,1.61,2.42,3.23,0.81,7.66,4.84,2.82,0.81,0.81,0.00,7.66,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.92,3.23,1.21,1.21,5.24,1.61,6.45,1.21,0.00,0.00,1.21,0.81,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.00,3.63,0.81,1.21,0.00,1.21,0.40,1.21,15.32,2.42,13.31,1.21,7.66,5.24,1.21,0.00,0.40,0.40,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.34,3.23,8.47,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,2.82,0.81,1.61,0.00,0.00

Whether you agree with the politics or not is up to you -- I generally do, but if you do not know already the magazine definitely leans left on the political spectrum but if you are considering purchasing this you should know that already. As for the actual layout (which really should form the review -- after all if you don't care for the politics what are the chances you have actually purchased a copy or tried a sample?), the Kindle really works well for The New Republic since it is largely image free in print.

The last two issues have been, for lack of a more elegant phrase, unreadable. Since the magazine re-launched under Mr. Chris Hughes, articles have been spliced together, text is jumbled, paragraphs run into each other, and everything from dollar signs to asterisks appear where letters should be, making reading more of a guessing game than an intellectual or relaxing experience. This has not just happened once, but with two consecutive issues of the magazine. And the mistakes are more than annoying: they will surely interrupt your reading flow, and make you regret the fact that you paid for such a lousy product.I typically do not write reviews online, though I thought I should warn potential customers in this case. I have really enjoyed The New Republic's writing and journalism for the past month - the book reviews were fantastic, the long-form, in-depth articles outstanding, and the commitment to ""wonkish"" topics suited my personal taste perfectly. Unfortunately, the magazine has made a distinct choice of putting out a sub-par product, one that will give you more headaches than joys.Even more disturbing was when I called The New Republic to complain. When I explained the mistakes and asked the operator how the magazine expects me to pay $2.25 for a virtually unreadable product, she said that the magazine ""apologizes for the mistakes"" and ""acknowledges that there are still kinks to work out"" with the re-launch. Make no mistake, this magazine is willing to sell you unreadable text for pure profit.

There were twists and turns throughout the book and I liked how her 'power' developed throughout the book. And Sebastian is so sweet. The book flowed smoothly and everything made sense.

Anyone looking at these reviews probably knows what The Economist is and believes the content to be great. The issue, here, is the Kindle offering, most notably, the price.Yes, it's expensive, and yes, I wish they'd reduce it a bit. But I'm not as outraged as some other reviewers.In comparing Kindle vs. web and paper, it is reasonable to consider, among all the factors discussed by others, the nature of Kindle itself. I notice that with the Kindle subscription, I find myself comfortably reading pretty much the whole issue. With print, I read just a small fraction.One factor, undoubtedly, is font adjustment. I'm getting to the age where reading hard-copy newspapers and magazines is becoming a bit of an exertion, so this is a huge factor. Of course web browsers allow for font adjustment, but I spend enough time working in front of a computer. I do cherish opportunities to do some things in different settings, such as an easy chair, or out on the lawn.I also wonder if the more stripped-down emphasis on text is a factor as well. There's not as much to look at with the Kindle edition (they do try to put in some pictures and charts, but visuals are not what Kindle does best). With the magazine, there's so much to look at, I spend too much time going back and forth. Ditto the web site, where there are so many things to click on. With Kindle, there are lots of little easily-digestible text nuggets and I just go from one to the next.I'm not sure if my explanations of why I read more on the Kindle version is accurate (I'll leave the details for amazon's usability experts to study), but I do notice the same phenomenon with my Kindle version of The New Yorker, where I abandoned the print version altogether.Speaking for myself, I'm getting a lot more bang for the buck with the Kindle subscription.

The articles can be intensely enriching, educational, and thoughtful. If you are looking for a light read on everyday pop culture and celebrities, stay away from this world class magazine that is written by and caters to the intellectuals. This is the magazine many high schools recommend to their students who want to improve their reading to a college level.  Its articles may confound those whose most challenging read has been the Mad Magazine and the National Enquirer.The Economist differs from most periodicals in the subject matter expertise and the quality of analysis. Apparently, the Economist attracts and hires only those who are already intimately familiar with the subject matter. Many writers have a Master's degrees or higher on the subject they are writing about. My guess is that the Economist magazine, which is over 150 years old, is not short on funds and can afford to pay the best and the brightest, even those who have had no previous interest in journalism, to come and write for the magazine.The political leaning of this magazine is best described as libertarian. The magazine definitely leans to the right and advocates government fiscal conservatism and anti-regulation. It is notable, however, that the Economist was very strongly anti-Bush (George W). The Economist called the George W Bush's administration incompetent, arrogant, misinformed, fiscally irresponsible, and full of cronyism.I give the Economist great deal of credit for making audacious, yet justified, criticisms of many dictatorships and other oppressive forces. The Economist has been banned in China for its undaunted criticism of China's human rights abuses.

So, I tried the 14 day trial in spite of the reviews here.After trying the Kindle version and experiencing its shortcomings, I think it's unconscionable and arrogant to ask the same price for the Kindle subscription, sans some of the satire / cartoons, etc. and particularly without the ability to use The Economist's website as allowed by the paper subscription. (Further, to add insult to injury, when I inquired if I could switch my subscription, as I still have months left on my paper sub, The Economist customer service replied there was no way to accomplish this.)Kindle is brilliant, but Amazon needs to watch the offerings' quality, feature set and pricing, or they will in the end lose traction to other, alternative readers. The digital age is certainly here, but we will see rapid innovation and change, lots of competition and hopefully price competition as well. To this Kindle reader, it appears Amazon is trying to leverage its brilliant start a bit too heavily with some high prices and incomplete products: perhaps tactically productive, but in my opinion much poorer strategy for developing a longtime committed customer base - something I always thought Amazon was adept at.",252,A3M2GOIB3HIXZD,"This time, this version: definitely NOT worth the price",9,2.0,252,86.34,24.98,39.76,47.81,42.00,27.38,82.54,48.02,8.73,5.56,4.76,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.40,3.17,8.33,14.68,5.16,4.37,8.33,1.59,11.11,5.95,3.97,0.40,0.40,3.17,5.16,3.17,1.98,0.00,0.79,0.40,2.78,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.08,1.59,2.38,1.98,5.56,1.59,3.57,1.59,1.19,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.40,0.40,0.00,0.00,6.75,0.40,3.97,2.38,1.19,0.40,2.38,6.35,1.19,11.51,1.19,5.56,4.37,6.35,1.19,0.40,4.37,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,14.68,3.17,7.94,0.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,1.19,0.79,0.40
B0027VSU9S,Kindle Store,"[11, 11]",3.0,1.0,2.2722513089005236,4.0,"I like The Economist as much as any of the other weekly news analysis/business magazine out there.  Of course that may be because I am more familiar with it - I had a subscription for several years up until early 2009.  At that time I was getting my news from several Internet sites as well as from 2 Kindle newspapers and couldn't see paying the price they were asking for ""old"" news.  When the Economist first came out on the Kindle I decided not to subscribe.  Now that I am using the Kindle DX, which is much more periodical friendly than the original Kindle, I have decided to start reading it again.So why do you read ""old"" news?  So it isn't up-to-the-second-as-it-happens, but most of what is in the magazine is still relevant.  There are always a few in-depth articles that help my understanding of the situation or bring up new ideas.For the most part the value of this type of magazine is the analysis and view point.  I happened to really like the type of analysis the give in this magazine and appreciate the different point of view.  I sometimes disagree with the conclusions the writers come to, but they always make me think.  Too often the conclusions of news analysis is based more on politics and emotion instead of the facts, but not here.The Kindle version of the Economist follows the print version very closely.  Many of the pictures are missing, but the important charts and graphics (and cartoon) are all present.  Blowing some charts and graphs up on my Kindle DX I have found the resolution to be excellent.  I could see a little frustration with the original Kindle, but the implementation/layout for Kindle 2/DX is great.Besides a few missing pictures the Kindle version is also missing all of the ads.  Although they were sometimes fun to read, particularly the job offerings, I don't miss them.  This does, however, bring up what seems to be the most import point to many here - price.Most periodicals rely very heavily on advertisement revenue to stay in business.  I don't know the exact numbers, but my guess is advertising more than pays the price for printing and postage.  In that case, e-versions of a magazine with no advertising sold at the same price as a paper subscription might even lose money, particularly if you remember that Amazon has to slice some off of the top to pay for your ""free"" 3G service.So, you get the same content but searchable, without the ads, guaranteed to be delivered where ever you happen to be at the time (never lost in the post, reaches you when on travel) at about the same price as the environmentally-unfriendly paper version.  Is it worth it?I think so.-Oh yes, I forgot online content.  Strangely enough I was never disconnected when I unsubscribed so I can still get in.  I also get daily e-mails.  I can count the times I've used the online content on the fingers of my right hand.  If you need it paying extra can be a drag and lowers the value of your Kindle subscription.  It might be worth calling or e-mailing The Economist about.  My guess - since you can discontinue at any time buying from your Kindle is, from their viewpoint, more like picking it up at the newsstand every week.- I can understand getting the paper version if more than one family member reads it - The New Yorker costs the same printer or kindle (don't see as many complaints) and I moved to print version when I discovered my wife was reading it on her Kindle.- One Last Word - It costs about as much as a large cup of coffee per issue but lasts longer....",649,AK7C1AJ9VLT32,Is it too Much to Pay for Great Content?,9,4.0,643,78.10,27.73,80.35,28.36,26.79,18.04,87.25,53.03,11.35,7.47,4.98,0.00,1.56,0.16,0.78,3.89,9.18,15.24,7.47,5.91,7.62,1.71,14.93,7.15,4.98,1.40,1.09,4.51,3.89,1.87,1.71,0.00,0.16,1.09,4.35,0.31,0.16,0.31,0.00,14.62,3.11,1.24,1.09,3.58,2.02,5.13,1.56,1.24,0.00,0.31,0.47,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.16,4.04,0.78,0.78,1.87,0.93,0.16,2.64,10.58,0.47,14.15,1.40,6.84,5.91,4.20,1.56,0.16,3.73,0.00,0.00,0.47,0.00,0.00,0.16,0.31,0.00,15.24,5.44,3.27,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.00,2.95,0.93,0.93,0.93,0.47

The Economist has FREE downloadable apps for multiple devices, so that subscribers can read the magazine on their phones or devices, but there is no app for the Kindle Fire.This appears to be Amazon's way of inserting itself into the cash flow river for magazine content. I am all in favor of profit, but this approach won't succeed. With few exceptions, serious readers of The Economist are going to get the full magazine content directly from the magazine publisher. They are not going to pay twice as much again for a watered-down version of this magazine just so they can read it on their Kindle or other tablet device. The same is likely true for most magazine and newspaper content.People who buy tablets like the Kindle Fire want a device that is going to make content access easier, not more difficut. They not going to allow themselves to get imprisoned in the manufacturer's corral. That is the ""America Online"" approach to access, which we know ends in economic stagnation and dwindling market share.I am sure that the secondary app market will address this problem soon enough and that I will be able to buy an app for $1.99 that will allow me to read The Economist on my Kindle Fire.

B0027VSU9S,Kindle Store,"[11, 11]",3.0,1.0,2.2722513089005236,4.0,"Overall, I am very pleased with the Kindle version of The Economist.  This was required reading material for me in college, and years later, I am still hooked -- without having to do assignments and recite in class, thank goodness.  The caliber of this magazine never fails to impress me.Content-wise, The Economist covers a wide variety of current events.  The magazine, published weekly, always starts off with a recap of what has happened in the world over the last week.  Contrary to its name, it sums up all of the major headlines from international politics and relations to natural disasters to legal news.  Of course, it also includes business and economic happenings as well.From there, The Economist delves into its cover story and several other introductory articles which are usually unrelated to each other.  Following this, there is a briefing on a particular subject, letters to the editor commenting on past stories, and a section focusing on digital highlights that can be found on the website.The Economist primarily breaks down its content by region.  There are sections dedicated to the week's events in the United States, the Americas, Asia, China, Middle East and Africa, Europe, Britain, and International.  There are also other sections that are not broken down geographically: Business, Finance and Economics, Science and Technology, Books and Arts, and Economics and Financial Indicators.  There is also a lengthy obituary for one person in each issue.  Occasionally, there will be a special report included pertaining to a topic that is particularly relevant at that present time.  There are also periodic publications within the magazine, such as the Technology Quarterly, that cover certain topics in further depth.  Some job postings are also included.There is a mixture of objective articles, subjective analyses, and opinion pieces in each section.  Given this variety of writing, I wouldn't suggest The Economist for anyone who is looking for newspaper-style reporting.  The authors are far less guarded in trying to mask their personal views.  Personally, I greatly appreciate this type of reporting; however, I can't honestly represent it as everyone's cup of tea.Another reason why I love The Economist is the variety of the content that it provides.  They publish a good number of interesting stories that most people probably would have never seen or heard elsewhere.  So you can read these and bring up them up at a dinner party so you can look extra smart in front of your friends. ;)Onto the Kindle format since this is what has so many people up in arms... the Kindle version does omit a lot of the ads and some of the cartoons that you would normally find in the print version.  Personally, I am pleased with the fewer ads, but I understand that some people do enjoy them since they are generally different that what you would find in other publications.  I do miss some of the cartoons, though.Because of the size of the Kindle screen, it is difficult to read from the page view without using the zoom function.  However, zooming in is easy enough to do, so I really don't mind this.  Also, you can switch from the page view to text view where the article appears like an actual book would on your device.For the Kindle Fire, you can bring up a scroll function at the bottom of your screen by tapping it.  From here, you can scroll from side to side to find a particular page (it shows a small picture of each page as well as a page number).  Tap on that icon to go directly to the page you want, tap again to make the scrolling table of contents disappear.  The only problem with this is that since the scrolling pictures are so small, it's hard to tell which page is which and which page you actually want to pull up.What I have found a little frustrating is that sometimes my Kindle won't bookmark or sync my current page.  When I try to resume reading, it pulls up the cover, and I have to go searching for my previous location.  Now I always make a mental note of my current page number when I stop reading.I do agree with others -- I am a little miffed that we don't get access to The Economist's online content through this subscription.  I'm sure that there is some fine print in the relationship between Amazon and the magazine itself, but I would really like to see them iron out this wrinkle.  For $9.99 a month, that content should be included.  The price for the other digital subscription available through their website (one year) is less than $70, and it includes online-only content.  The Kindle version costs almost as much as the print subscription (which also includes online-only content) yet still lacks this feature.  It is rather frustrating.",834,A10QVHHPD3GY6R,Mostly Happy With It,4,4.0,815,75.32,46.56,37.82,60.66,23.97,22.94,83.44,54.11,13.13,5.52,3.07,0.12,1.47,0.00,0.86,7.61,8.59,15.09,7.73,6.50,6.01,1.23,12.02,5.28,2.94,1.72,0.61,3.19,3.68,2.70,0.86,0.00,0.25,0.25,5.15,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.00,10.80,1.47,1.10,1.60,2.58,1.23,3.31,2.33,1.96,0.12,0.25,0.49,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.25,4.05,0.74,0.37,1.96,0.37,0.86,1.47,10.43,0.25,12.88,0.98,7.61,4.29,4.66,1.35,0.00,1.96,0.00,0.12,0.49,0.00,0.12,0.12,0.25,0.00,14.85,5.52,5.89,0.12,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.98,0.00,1.23,0.74,0.25

First, there's no advertising in the Kindle edition.  That alone is a big hit for the Economist in profit, so it makes sense that either other features would be left out or the price raised.  Second, the free wireless delivery.  Amazon does not get free use of the 3g network.  They have to front that cost somewhere in order to give us the free 3g, and it's not in the cost of the device, especially with the newest generation 3g model only costing $189.  The ability to receive the magazine wherever you are, instantly, and then carry at least the last 7 issues with you at almost no extra cost of space or weight is great!  The last point I would make is that Amazon has not become as big as it has by operating at a loss.

The Economist is a fantastic publication so I'm writing this to make sure people aren't giving the magazine undeserved flak, and that people here understand what's going on behind the scenes...Here is the issue: The Economist, like most other major publications, provides lots of value-added features to subscribers but make limited access to their website free for SEO and ad revenue generating purposes. These subscriber features include: full audio podcasts, full access to apps and commentary, and of course full digital access to the printed content. The digital subscriptions and authentication to access this content happens directly on the Economist's servers, so features served from the Economist's servers are easily matched and delivered to subscribers. AMAZON'S KINDLE DELIVERY INFRASTRUCTURE has a separate user database, separate servers, and a separate transfer protocol that is 100% independent of the Economist.This wouldn't be a problem, except that AMAZON DOES NOT ALLOW PUBLICATIONS TO AUTHENTICATE AGAINST AMAZON USERS SUBSCRIBING TO THE PUBLICATIONS' OWN PRODUCT! This is technically easy to do by implementing an API for publishers. But without it The Economist has no way of knowing who is subscribing through Amazon, so they cannot offer the digital features to kindle subscribers.This is how it SHOULD work (listen up Amazon):1) You pay for the Kindle subscription2) You then sign up with a free account at Economist.com that doesn't have any subscription rights to it (yet)3) You add your amazon info to your Economist user account4) The Economist's server pings the Amazon server, and the Amazon server says ""Yup, this guy is definitely a paying subscriber, and he is paid up through XX/XX/XXXX""5)You get the Kindle subscription every week, plus the ability to log in to the Economist.com with a newly subscriber-enhanced user account.This doesn't work because Amazon does not allow step 4 in the above example. The Economist would LOVE to give Kindle subscribers digital access, but there's no practical way to do this because Amazon refuses to implement APIs to make Step 4 possible. The lack of digital subscriber features here is 100% AMAZON'S FAULT!Why the same price? When you sign up as a digital subscriber directly at Economist.com, they get 100% of the $120, but from a Kindle subscription they only receive $84 out of $120 retail price on Amazon (bummer). If they charged less, they'd get only $70 or $60... and last I checked the newspaper industry isn't profitable enough to take deeper and deeper cuts into it's retail price. However, they are economists over there (just a hunch) and as a result I think they chose the CORRECT pricing strategy of $120 for the Kindle edition. Here's why: The Economist takes a 30% haircut and delivers a sub-par product via Amazon (because it doesn't include extra features), so they're subtly encouraging a reasonable person to just subscribe directly with Economist.com to receive the superior product. They make a subscription on kindle available simply to appease those few subscribers who must have a whispersynced copy formatted like the print edition on their Kindle and wouldn't subscribe under any other arrangement. In effect, kindlers are paying the ""Amazon's Infrastructure Sucks For Publishers"" tax by paying the same but getting less.Unfortunately, most people's negative reviews blame the publisher for not getting the extra digital features, and interested parties are looking at these comments and writing off The Economist completely, instead of taking exception specifically to the service Amazon pigeon-holes publishers into. Of course The Economist can't really say this on Amazon, but I have no problem laying it down for them. So for my fellow Amazoners, don't just choose between subscribing or passing on the Economist, consider the kindle or (direct) digital option as well, and vote this comment up so others can see it.",644,A3DSNKDGSGWTZX,Subscriptions: Kindle vs Digital vs Print,6,5.0,665,85.46,48.20,13.15,51.07,36.94,27.82,78.05,47.67,8.27,3.61,0.75,0.00,1.05,0.15,1.65,4.66,9.02,14.14,6.47,4.81,6.62,2.71,11.58,4.81,1.95,1.05,2.26,2.26,3.76,2.56,1.20,0.00,0.30,0.00,6.92,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.45,13.23,1.35,3.16,1.50,2.11,1.50,4.81,1.20,0.30,0.75,0.00,0.30,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.62,0.45,0.90,1.95,2.71,0.60,0.30,9.92,0.30,9.02,1.50,6.62,1.20,6.92,0.45,0.00,5.56,0.00,0.00,0.75,0.15,0.45,0.15,0.15,0.00,18.50,4.36,4.21,0.45,0.00,0.15,0.30,0.60,0.60,3.61,2.41,1.80

Contrary to some reviewers I do not think the Kindle edition is expensive.  For me, now living in Ireland, its weekly price is less than the daily cost of a good Irish newspaper.  Over the past four decades its editorial standards have varied--there have been times when I felt that its extremely bright editors were sometimes being just too clever for their own good.  But in recent years it has been very good indeed. Its global and business news coverage is unsurpassed and presented in an accessible and very readable way.But to be useful one needs to read it regularly soon after publication.  When I was working, I travelled a lot, often for weeks at a time, and I alternated between a regular print subscription, supplemented by single copy purchases when I was away, or simply purchased it at local newstands wherever I was.  When I retired and moved to Ireland the problem has been that there is no postal delivery on a Saturday. Sometimes Monday is a public holiday, so one gets it on Tuesday, and occasionally there are glitches and it arrives only on Wednesday.  Since it goes to the printer at c.o.b. on Thursday, this makes it six days late.When I was in the US this summer I experimented with the Kindle edition and liked it.  So when I returned to Ireland, I cancelled my print subscription and took out a Kindle one, downloadable to my computer each Friday.  In some respects it is an improvement on the print edition--its table of contents is a marvel of organisation, go instantly to articles of particular interest, and Kindle also knows exactly where you stopped reading.  Its main drawback, and the reason I give it only three stars, is that the Economist is wonderful for its presentation of data , and that very many of its articles include statistical tables and charts.  In print and on the website these are in colour.  These are obviously available on the Kindle only in black and white--which is a drawback--but much worse is the fact that they are too small to be readable--at least by me by me but I would guess also by most people.

Certainly the marginal cost per electronic subscriber is infinitesimal or zero.But the editorial (content-creation) cost is the same for print and electronic editions.  And that cost is generally covered by advertising, which the Kindle doesn't have (thank God).So we should be willing to pay -- and perhaps pay well -- for electronic, advertising-free editions of distinctive publications (like the New York Times, or The Economist) to keep them going.  The loss of these publications would be a great loss for the world; blogs just won't fill the gap left by the demise of professional publications.I am a rabid Kindle enthusiast and evangelist.  But the problem here -- as noted by Joe K. -- is the disproportionate share of the subscription price going to Amazon (70% Amazon/30% publisher).  If Amazon persists in grabbing a disproportionate share of subscription revenue, readers and high-quality content creators will find other ways to connect and support each other.

While it is true that the Kindle edition of the Economist is priced similar, perhaps even slightly higher than the comparable print edition, you must realize that the price paid for a print subscription is heavily subsidized via advertising.  True the cost of delivery and materials are significantly less, however, you must keep in mind the Economist is not receiving any money from advertisers.  Furthermore, it is unclear how much of the cost is going to Amazon.  Taking all this into consideration, I doubt the Economist is making any greater margin on the Kindle edition than on their print edition.  In fact, I would guess they are probably making less.  The only legitimate argument I have heard, and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that the Kindle subscription should most certainly come with the same web access afforded to print subscribers.  That being said, I am sure there is some technical hurdles preventing easy verification of a legitimate Kindle subscription.

I'm delighted to see it (finally) available on the Kindle.The Kindle edition is of good quality; certainly no worse than any other similar Kindle magazine.  I'm very happy to see that this edition preserves some of the charts and illustrations of the print version.  However, I hoped that it would have preserved more of a magazine-like layout, particularly on the DX.  These Kindle magazines are certainly readable, but can be a bit monotonous.Regarding the price, I really don't understand all the outrage.First, this is The Economist: it has always been more expensive.  The Economist is a high-quality, thriving news magazine in a time when many of its peers have folded or have adopted dumbed-down content to attract a larger audience.  Its pricing policy is certainly one reason the magazine continues to do well.Second, though the Kindle edition reduces publishing costs for the magazine, it also does away with advertisements.  This is not a book; it is a periodical.  Magazines (and newspapers) generate the bulk of their revenue through advertisements.  Even net of physical distribution costs, subscription prices don't cover production costs.  I'm perfectly happy to pay a regular subscription rate to avoid being sold the latest brand of toothpaste with every turn of the page.I can't fathom how someone spends $400 or $500 on a Kindle, only to complain that $.30 per day is too expensive for The Economist.

And like your weight-driven work-outs, you will reap immediate and long-term benefits, including a greater understanding of world events and how they shape the world today.This is a tremendous publication and I am extremely thankful that it exists. The amount of information it conveys about our world each week is unparalleled.I began reading this magazine in paper format about five years ago. I now read it exclusively on the Kindle, which I find extremely convenient. (I understand that you do not gain access to the web-based articles with the Kindle subscription, but I find the convenience of the Kindle format well worth the additional cost and lack of web access. I also find it ludicrous that people give one-star ratings based upon the lack of web access alone, rather than speaking for the content of the publication itself. So it goes.)The writing is smart and never condescending. It is also not too ""pop"", like a lot of news magazines can be. I honestly don't care what Lady Gaga is doing (and with whom), and thankfully neither does The Economist.The Economist often has a view (which they will openly state) in the articles it presents, but I see this more as a ""common sense"" worldly perspective, not a heavily-biased slant which many periodicals have - without admitting as much. The Economist should not ""rankle"" those from the Left or Right politically, it often takes the sides of either, depending on the issue in question. I consider myself an Independent politically, and find this view refreshing.The benefits of this magazine are two-fold - at least.  Firstly, the amount of knowledge that you will gain about the world in which we live is phenomenal. The coverage is extensive, including articles about the upcoming French election, as well as Boeing's attempt to keep up with demands of numerous airlines.  Secondly, I just feel better about myself when reading The Economist. There's no better way to describe it, but I simply enjoy the feeling that reading this magazine gives me. Every issue I read, I keep thinking... ""Oh yeah! I should discuss this with my wife/friend/co-worker..."" or ""Oh man...

It just gets you thinking...  a lot.The Economist also gives you a fresh perspective of the world and our place in it. I think this is important now more than ever, as we are bombarded daily with many black/white, yes/no, for/against issues, regarding everything from Apple vs. Windows, Democrats vs Republicans, etc.  The Economist presents insightful nuances of the issues it presents, giving the reader pause for thought rather than leading to knee-jerk, sound-bite conclusions.There is also a Business section each week, containing articles which are easily on par with those in Business Week or any other business-focused periodical.You can obviously garner a lot of world news information online for free from various web sites. But if you want a single source of intelligent and comprehensive information about the world we live in, you need look no further. The articles are very well-presented, containing not only the information, but a thoughtful interpretation about the events within the article as well.Be prepared to learn a lot.

I decided to give it a shot, and I regret it. I was expecting The Economist to give me an unbiased, unique perspective of current and past global issues and their economic intricacies, but instead what I got was a very pro-liberal magazine. I'm an American conservative and I don't mind a good debate. I want to read a newspaper, magazine or watch a news broadcast that pays attention to both sides of the isle; I think it's healthy. Oftentimes my opinion varies on certain issues in the political continuum. But The Economist doesn't even offer other views a chance. With regard to European politics, it bashes viewpoints other than liberal. It blames Angela Merkel for the result of the Eurozone crises and for not instantly, freely opening up the vault of Germany to other European nations, without consequence, for bailout upon the first hint of trouble. It bashes David Cameron's policies as failed, laughable, and abhorrent for Britian. As for American politics, it refers to the conservative base as a 'dwindling constituency of old white men.'Give me a break. This is kind of stuff is the same jumbled malarkey which MSNBC released every day and calls it news. I don't mind a good, healthy debate from both sides, but with The Economist's reputation, I was expecting more. To be fair, the only slightly positive remark I have towards The Economist is that it offers international financial news and information regarding smaller and (less consequential) contries, which can sometimes be worthwhile. But that is not a saving grace. I won't be resubscribing. Truth be told, I sometimes toss it aside in disgust.I want readers to know what they're getting. This forum is for reviews.

Since obtaining a Kindle (and later on a Kindle DX) I have discovered periodicals and the in-depth reporting service they provide. It is a bit of a shame to see the newspaper, magazine industry struggle as I have seen that they provide a very valuable place in society (at least the high quality publications do). Items like the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and now the Economist provide VERY high quality content and it has been so refreshing to read in depth coverage rather than having to rely on superficial TV coverage along with a focus on non-news items.On the one hand, I do feel that the price set for the Kindle edition of the Economist is a bit high. On the other hand I have been reading a few Economist print issues before (and have now activated the 14 day trial for my Kindle DX). This is a very high quality publication. What price should a well researched, highly informative, and quality version of a publication receive? If we are only willing to pay rock bottom prices for content, we will invariably get rock bottom quality material.No doubt this is one of those high quality content publications. The Kindle edition only adds convenience and portability to an excellent publication. If the convenience and portability do not justify the price for you, then I would suggest you stick with the print edition. Please also realized that the Kindle edition contains absolutely no adds to offset/subsidize the cost. Also, if the current implementation/limitations of the Kindle periodicals (i.e. DRM issues, color, etc) are not to your liking, I would also suggest the print version. For me the Kindle version is the best and most convenient way to read The Economist.After reading my first Kindle edition, I have been very pleased with the content and the fact that The Economist staff has provided a nicely formatted Kindle version. I stopped my LA Times subscription due to the awful formatting issues as well as the lack of pictures/charts. The Economist Kindle edition does not have formatting issues and the charts/images look really good on my Kindle DX. The articles are divided into sections that are very easy to navigate with using the Kindle. I can easily pick the articles I want to read as well as the articles that I want to skip.I'm very impressed with the quality of the content (which is not a surprise really), and the superb formatting work put in to make sure that The Economist looks good on the Kindle (DX).If I were looking at both products (The Kindle version and the print version) and both were roughly the same price, I would definitely pick the Kindle version for convenience.

Having just got my Kindle Fire, i thought I'd see if the Economist was ported to it (previous reviews had criticized it, but I think they referred to pre-Fire versions). Rather than subscribe for a full year without knowing how it looked on the Fire, I thought I'd dip my toe in by purchasing a single issue first. And I'm glad I did. The Kindle edition is in no way worth it.  What you get is simply a copy of the printed magazine that you can read online. But isn't that what you want? you may well reason. Um, no, not really. What I expect is a VERSION of the printed magazine that works on and - more importantly - takes advantage of the capabilities of my device. Unfortunately The Economist has made very little effort to use any of the features of the Kindle. What you do get is two options: an exact copy of the printed version (which is the default) or a 'text' version, which is an extremely rudimentary page-flipper with about as much visual interest as a screen of block type. Which is what it is.The copy of the printed version contains every page from the printed version (including the adverts - annoyingly, you sometimes have to scroll through three full pages of adverts just to get to the next article), exactly as-is - same page-based (not screen-based) layout, and still only flippable by page. Even if an article continues on the next page, all you get is the same printed arrow indicating this - no text flow, no hyperlinked ""More..."" or anything. It's like they just scanned in the printed edition and uploaded that. Even more annoying than this complete lack of online navigational features is the actual content itself. In this view, the article text is a pure IMAGE - not text display. So it comes out slightly blurry (or at least less than sharp) at maximum zoom (which is still not really that big - too bad if you have poor eyesight). On a 7"" tablet the un-zoomed text is a strain to read. The only way to zoom in is to pinch-and-zoom (although this is limited to about a 2x zoom which still only comes out at about 7pt text...), but then you find yourself scrolling around the screen trying to read a whole article. So the 'print view' is pretty much useless on the Kindle Fire.The 'text view' is thankfully at least legible, and does offer the basic built-in Kindle features to change the font size, but it is an appallingly cut-price 'conversion' (and I use the term conversion very loosely). Each article is presented effectively as 'flat text' sometimes with a lead-in image, but most often not, and all you can do is flip between pages as you would a novel. There is no 'click' to expand for images, no nice scrolling of articles, and absolutely no effort made to cater for (not even take advantage of) the capabilities of the device.To be fair, the 'print view' does include a scrollable set of thumbnails, but clicking on either just sends you to the relevant page (and if it contains multiple articles you're left to your own devices to rove around the page looking for what you want). Both the 'print view' and the 'text view' include a workable table of contents, but it's pretty visually uninteresting.  I know The Economist markets itself on its words, and ultimately I guess that's what you're paying for, but really, I'd expect at least some effort to take advantage of a medium, rather than just shoehorning a 'built for paper' version into it.Do I expect too much? No, I don't think so. I also subscribe to Time (actually it was a gift). The print subscription comes with a free Kindle (or iPad or anything else) version - there's even a specific app for it. This app is GREAT! All articles are reformatted specifically for the Kindle Fire screen, fit on it perfectly without the need for zooming, use an incredibly intuitive and easy-to-use touch-based interface, has a decent table of contents with jumps to articles, etc., etc.. It has overlaid pull-outs, pop-outs, embedded video, and is just a sheer pleasure to use. It really shows what can be done if you are willing to put a bit of time and effort into it.I MUCH prefer the Economist as a serious magazine but the Time Kindle Edition really puts the Economist's efforts to shame. I look forward to reading Time on my Kindle Fire (even more so than the print version), but The Economist is just so uninviting. It's like going back to Bulletin Boards in the early days of the Internet, after having spent years on a feature-rich multimedia browser - something you'd only consider as an emergency backup. Certainly I would never choose to read the Kindle version of the Economist if I had the paper version.I really hope that someone at The Economist reads these reviews, because they must try harder if they expect people to pay for this woefully sub-par offering. They need to look at what Time has done, and then match that.Me, I'm glad I only wasted $4.95 on a single copy, instead of $110 on the annual subscription.

It would probably help if the reader would also partake of a similar inebriant before attempting the book.I started the book 3 times previously over the last 45 years and was determined to finish it this time.  I was trying to understand why it is rated so highly on the list of all time fiction.  I am still baffled.  Actually, I don&#8217;t know why it is classified as fiction since it is basically an autobiography.The book starts off with some amusing anecdotes from the author&#8217;s early life.  Then it quickly descends into psychological drivel which continues throughout the middle half of the book.  Apparently, people who rate books have decided to read more into the words than what is actually there.Eventually, Joyce returns to real life and inexplicably slips into journal mode.  I think that while writing the book, which was originally serialized, he forgot what he was writing about and just kind of babbled forward.The book is a real struggle with little reward for the reader.

Sylvia Robson lives with her parents on a farm, and is loved by her rather dull Quaker cousin Philip. She, however, meets and falls in love with Charlie Kinraid, a sailor on a whaling vessel, and they become engaged, although few people know of the engagement. When Kinraid goes back to his ship, he is press-ganged--forcibly enlisted in the Royal Navy, a scene witnessed by Philip. Philip does not tell Sylvia of the incident and, believing her lover is dead, Sylvia eventually marries her cousin and they have a daughter. Inevitably, Kinraid returns to claim Sylvia and she discovers that Philip knew he was still alive. Philip leaves her in despair at her rage and rejection, but she refuses to leave with Kinraid.Philip joins the army, and ends up fighting in the Napoleonic wars where he saves Kinraid's life. Kinraid goes back to Britain, and his wife, who knows nothing of their history together, goes to Sylvia to tell her that her husband is a hero. Sylvia then realizes she is actually in love with Philip, and Kinraid's marriage suggests to her that he was not as faithful to her as she had believed. Philip meanwhile was horribly disfigured by a shipboard explosion, and returns to the small Northumbrian village to try to see his child. He ends up staying with Sylvia's parents' servant's sister and rescues his child when she nearly drowns. In saving his daughter he is fatally injured, but is reconciled with his wife as he dies.",282,A2FZC65GY3BIIF,Plot spoiler Alert...

As long as delivery is consistent throughout the trial period I think I'll keep the subscription.I don't read the print AJC very often unless someone leaves one laying around. I can tell that the Kindle edition probably has a few less features, but for the price I can't really complain. It has the main national and state news stories that I care about reading. It has at least the main story image for most of the stories that have images. The sections are well organized and easy to navigate.Pros:- Easy to navigate through individual articles, from article to article, and by section. There can even browse by full text and summary which is awesome- Includes images (it seems many Kindle papers do not)- Titles, image quotes, and story text are all clearly differentiated- Includes opinions, special sections, obituaries and pretty much all the content of the print edition as far as I can tell.Cons:- Seems to be missing weather, tv listings, etc. Probably due to formatting issues.Overall:- Other newspapers should take a cue from the AJC. They seem to have made some pretty big overhauls in the past few months based on info in previous reviews.

You don't get anything in map or table form, such as weather, comics, TV listings, puzzles, or sports standings.  You also don't get some syndicated features, such as Dear Abby and other advice columns.You do get all the special local sections.  The AJC publishes a daily Gwinnett News for newspapers distributed in that county (a holdover from when there was a competing newspaper there).  You also get all the weekly local sections for other parts of the metro area.  Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, you do get the Sunday paper, but it's missing some material that doesn't originate with the AJC, such as Parade magazine.As for the quality of the AJC itself, it is not a world class newspaper and doesn't try to be.  It relies almost entirely on wire services for national and international events, and coverage of state and local issues is sometimes brilliant, sometimes nonexistent.  It's coverage of local business and real estate is certainly good, though, and sports coverage is outstanding.  There are a couple of excellent sports columnists, and coverage of SEC and ACC college football is extensive and year round.The newsstand price of the AJC is now $6.50 a week, so the Kindle version is certainly a good value.

Generally, this is a perfectly sufficient strategy, and it's a pleasure to read electronic material such that I can change to a comfortable font.  However, the font in this magazine seems scanned, rather than being based on vector, postscript or other re-sizable technology.

The stories are all very well written.  Each issue includes an About the Author and some Q&A; with the author.I docked a star because I am still not exactly clear about the pricing and publishing schedule.  It costs $1.49/month, but I thought I saw they are delivered every 3 weeks.  The dates I listed below are the ""publish"" dates, not the dates they arrived on my Kindle, and they don't seem to be the same time apart.  I see there's an Oct 6 issue on line, but it has not arrived on my Kindle yet (as of Oct 15)...At any rate, to give an idea of what the stories are like, here are brief descriptions of the stories I've read so far.Aug 10:  ""Frost Mountain Picnic Massacre,"" by Seth Fried, 4610 wordsA surreal story about a town that turns out every year for an annual picnic outside of town.  Each year some horrible, bizarre disaster happens, yet every year they go again.  It's written somewhat in the style of ""The Lottery"", a short story we studied in school decades ago.  The descriptions are bright and cheerful, but there many hints at these dark sinister forces at work that no one seems able to confront.  I don't want to give away a lot of the story.  This was a really unique story, and if they were all, or mostly, as original as this one, I'd say One Story is a bargain at twice the price.Aug 30:  ""Desiderata,"" by Jennifer Haigh, 6174 wordsA story about an aging widow and her relationship with her deceased husband and (platonicaly) with the retired janitor from the school at which her husband was the principal.  Through the span of the story she discovers some things about her husband, and about herself, that she'd not known before.  While this one was very well written, and I really enjoyed the ending, I've read too many other stories about aging widows looking back on their lives, such that I kept waiting to see what is unique about this one.Sept 10: ""Stag,"" by Rob McCarthy, 6553 wordsAnother quite unique story, centered on a recovered alcoholic young father who has recently separated from his alcoholic wife, for the sake of their five year old daughter.  He moves into an abandoned house outside of town, hoping that the surrounding quiet and nature will be good for his daughter and their relationship.  The title refers to a stag that appears in the middle of the story and takes a center role through the rest of the story.  Again, I don't want to spoil anything.  I didn't ""enjoy"" this story as much as the picnic one above, but not because it isn't a great story.  It is very intense, and a bit emotionally wrenching, leaving me in a bad mood!  This story incorporates some nice symbolism, and really beautifully ties the symbolism into the story line at the ending.I especially enjoyed the Q&A; with the authors at the ends of these stories.  It is surprising to see what motivated them and where the elements come from.I imagine you could google the authors or titles and learn more details about the stories on line.I sense from the three I've read so far that the stories will cover all different genres and writing styles.

He also worked as an instructor in Public Speaking at Yale University.  Originally published in 1917 by the Funk & Wagnalls Company of encyclopedia fame, this work is surprising in its depth, not just for its forty-word and 295-character title, including spaces.It should be noted that on the downside, there is no Table of Contents, at least in this particular free Kindle version. This Kindle edition,Fifteen Thousand Useful Phrases, is said to have a table of contents so that you don't have to constantly press on the Kindle's 'Next Page' button on my Kindle to navigate to the section you want. It will cost you a buck, maybe more, but that's why we have choices between free or paid.After getting past a rather random preface of sorts, we find what's called a PLAN OF CLASSIFICATION, followed by a listing of the eleven sections.  There's an interesting introduction by Frank H. Vizetelly, a lexicographer, etymologist and editor who was employed by publishers Funk & Wagnalls to act as an editor for the firm's dictionaries and encyclopedia. He was also the author ofA Desk Book Of Idioms And Idiomatic Phrases In English Speech And Literature.Author Kleiser follows with a preface entitled How To Use This Book, followed by a Plan Of Study which outlines the eleven sections that we will see below, with some examples of some of the more interesting phrases encountered among the 15,000 offered in this work.  I can only list a few of the more interesting, out of the ordinary or witty ones encountered, and have done this by the sections in which they were found in this book.  Some of these may appear as being misspelled, but they were transcribed here as the author himself wrote them, including his explanatory notes which have been left in their original brackets.SECTION I: Useful PhrasesA: ""abandoned hope"", ""amatory effusions [amatory = expressive of sexual love]""C: ""conjugal felicity""D: ""damask cheek [damask = rich patterned fabric; wavy pattern on Damascus steel]""E: ""effulgent daybeams [effulgent = radiating light]""S: ""sesquipedalian words [sesquipedalian = long]""SECTION II: Significant PhrasesA: ""abashed and ashamed"", ""abstinence and self-denial""B: ""babel and confusion"", ""bigots and blockheads""G: ""galling and humiliating"", ""glib and loquacious [loquacious = very talkative]""SECTION III: Felicitous PhrasesA: ""abstruse, metaphysical, and idealistic""E: ""effluent, radiating, and fructifying [fructifying = Make fruitful or productive]"", ""egotistic, disdainful, and proud""J: ""jealousy, exclusiveness, and taciturnity [taciturnity = habitually untalkative]""O: ""obstinacy, stupidity, and willfulness"", ""officious, fidgety, and talkative""W: ""waddling, perspiring, and breathless""SECTION IV: Impressive PhrasesA: ""able, skilful, thorough, and genuine""C: ""captious, petulant, peevish, and splenetic [captious = point out trivial faults]""F: ""fanatic, enthusiast, visionary, and zealot"", ""fancy, humor, vagary, and caprice [vagary = extravagant or erratic notion or action]"", ""fop, coxcomb, puppy, and jackanapes [jackanapes = conceited person]""O: ""obdurate, unfeeling, callous, and obstinate""Q: ""quack, imposture, charlatan, and mountebank [mountebank = flamboyant charlatan]""S: ""scandalize, vilify, traduce, and offend [traduce = humiliate with false statements]""SECTION V: Prepositional PhrasesPreposition ""of""...B: ""babel of tongues""H: ""harbor of refuge"", ""harvest of regrets""J: ""jangle of sounds"", ""jargon of philosophy""S: ""savoring of quackery"", ""sting of satire""Preposition ""by""...B: ""ballasted by brains""Preposition ""in""...B: ""barren in intellect""W: ""wallow in idolatry""Preposition ""into""...B: ""bullied into silence""K: ""kindle into action""L: ""lapse into pedantry [pedantries = attention to detail or rules]""Preposition ""to""...F: ""fly to platitudes"", ""foredoomed to failure""R: ""reduced to impotence"", ""repeat to satiety"", ""run to seed""Preposition ""with""...C: ""cling with tenacity"", ""clothe with authority"", ""covered with ignominy""K: ""kindle with enthusiasm""S: ""seething with sedition [sedition = conduct or language inciting rebellion]""SECTION VI: Business PhrasesF: ""Frankly, we believe it is extremely worth while for you""I: ""I am confident that you will be thoroughly satisfied"", ""I am giving the matter my personal attention""Y: ""You are certainly justified in complaining""V: ""vehicle of intercourse"", ""vicissitudes of life [vicissitudes = sudden or unexpected changes]""SECTION VII: Literary ExpressionsA: ""A broad, complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his nose and lips""B: ""Beaming with pleasurable anticipation""C: ""Cold gaze of curiosity""F: ""Familiar and endearing intimacy"", ""Felicitousness in the choice and exquisiteness in the collocation of words""H: ""Half choked by a rising paroxysm of rage""J: ""Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling""R: ""Ransack the vocabulary""S: ""Sacrificed to a futile sort of treadmill"", ""She felt herself carried off her feet by the rush of incoherent impressions""SECTION VIII: Striking SimilesA: ""A blind rage like a fire swept over him"", ""A book that rends and tears like a broken saw"", ""A breath of melancholy made itself felt like a chill and sudden gust from some unknown sea""B: ""Beauty maddens the soul like wine"", ""Beheld great Babel, wrathful, beautiful, burn like a blood-red cloud upon the plain""Q: ""Quaking and quivering like a short-haired puppy after a ducking""SECTION IX: Conversational PhrasesA: ""A most extraordinary idea!"", ""A thousand hopes for your success"", ""All that is conjecture"", ""An unfortunate comparison, don't you think?""E: ""Either way is perplexing"", ""Eminently proper, I think"", ""Excuse my bluntness""H: ""Happily there are exceptions to every rule"", ""Have I incurred your displeasure?""

I've only listed the freebies here, but if you do a search on the author's name, many others will appear.According to a recent article in Wikipedia, the ""average persons' active vocabulary consists of 10,000 words, regardless of native tongue.""  This is interesting because it represents a meager fraction of the lexis of that language in that according to theNew Oxford American Dictionary, there are more than 350,000 words, phrases, and senses, though other sources place this as closer to roughly 600,000 words.  These discrepancies are partly due to relative simplicity of spoken language to written language.  Additionally, one may understand more words than one uses, meaning that one's working vocabulary may not be representative of one's total knowledge of a language.A 1987 research on native English speaking university graduates found an average vocabulary size of 17,200 base words.  With the numbing down of television, one might wonder if that's still true.For those who are adventurous, the text-to-speech feature in this book is enabled.  Check your documentation for your particular model, but if you have a Kindle 2 you can start text to speech in the Text menu while you are reading. Hold down the 'Shift' key and press the 'SYM' key to stop or play.  Some of the results are quite comical, as you may find.I'll call this a 5-star read if just for its vast content of phrases, but only a 2-star book because of the lack of an active Table of Contents.  Still, in recognition of the late author's fascinating work here, I'll raise it to a 4-star offering, and if Greenville Kleiser were alive today, it would be a 5-star read due to his meticulous nature in editing.To quote the author: ""And now I have completed my review""... hope that it was helpful.2/2/2012",1468,AEJAGHLC675A7,"""Pelted with an interminable torrent of words""",7,4.444444444444445,1541,90.58,64.92,6.98,56.41,67.00,29.85,69.31,41.21,8.44,4.54,1.62,0.26,1.49,0.84,0.32,3.89,6.68,13.63,5.26,2.47,5.78,0.45,9.15,5.00,2.34,0.97,2.34,2.73,5.52,3.50,1.88,0.26,0.78,0.45,6.55,0.06,0.19,0.26,0.58,9.47,2.34,1.49,1.30,2.86,0.97,2.34,2.73,0.78,1.04,0.52,1.88,0.91,0.52,0.13,0.32,3.50,0.52,1.36,1.17,0.58,0.32,2.14,5.52,1.36,7.98,1.04,5.06,1.75,3.18,0.91,0.00,0.58,0.13,0.06,1.17,0.06,1.04,0.19,0.06,0.00,40.62,3.24,9.86,5.06,0.06,0.32,0.19,1.04,15.31,1.62,0.13,3.76

I finished reading Board Resolution and the wonder that someone could write such a combination of a nebulous teenage wet dream and the fantasies of every inadequate woman hater was overwhelming.The premise that a woman who was as powerful and masterful in a male dominated world of high finance could be reduced to some trembling and sexually desperate slave was such a stretch for my human mind to begin with that I could hardly believe that the author would push me even farther into fantasy land with the thought that a bit of date rape combined with a most creative gang-bang which would be ""just what she needed"" just pushed me over the edge of any possibility to see this as anything more than literary porn written to appeal to men with inadequate equipment and women with severe mental problems.I should pause for a moment to make sure you understand that I am not a fan of erotica (much less BDSM). The reason has nothing to do with the sex but much to do with the fact that almost all of it (with a few notable exceptions) is poorly written, has little if anything resembling a plot outside of writing about sex in various incarnations and generally reduces the characters to little more than what can be done in the erogenous areas between ones legs. The writings of Larissa Ione are more to my speed in this area since she weaves her erotic scenes into an overall plot that while including sex in various forms have an end game that includes more than an orgasm.Back to the story at hand, our dual personality heroine Savannah, who apparently can run a billion dollar corporation but has the need to be date raped and treated like a piece of meat by Matthew Lord Kensington (ya gotta love that name) and brought to the pinnacle of self awareness by a gang-bang of sorts with his buddies. I know what you are thinking, ""What a fantastic love story"" &lt; sarcasm/off> but somewhere along the way anything resembling reality checked out and it might as well have been Star Trek porn (and the actions of this version of ""Scotty the engineer"" are about as impossible as getting that extra bit of warp drive).The HEA of this makes my head spin since I would have tasered his ass on about page 11 and end of story or if I let things play out in this nightmarish scenario, the next step should have been Savannah getting a sexy 40 caliber Glock and polishing these boys off this earth. Apparently, my naivety in the world of BDSM did not realize the proper reaction is to be grateful to the rapists and fall madly in love with one of them. Such is this story and since I don't have a number smaller than the national debt to measure the incredulity of this story all I can say is that it does have a ""train wreck"" appeal but any lasting compulsion to read it again would have me wondering if my secret desire is to become a serial rapist.",525,A3NVB6HKMUH2NM,Well If You Can't Seduce Them I Guess It's OK To Rape Them,13,2.0,531,84.63,53.77,18.54,22.84,75.86,19.21,87.38,55.56,12.43,5.27,3.39,0.19,0.56,0.94,0.19,6.97,8.85,16.76,9.60,3.77,5.27,0.75,14.88,5.65,3.77,1.51,0.75,3.95,5.84,2.82,3.01,0.94,1.32,0.56,7.53,0.00,0.94,1.32,0.94,14.50,2.45,1.51,3.77,4.52,1.13,3.01,0.94,0.19,0.19,0.38,4.52,0.94,0.00,3.01,0.19,4.71,1.51,0.94,1.88,0.56,0.19,2.26,9.04,0.38,11.49,1.88,6.78,3.01,1.32,0.94,0.00,0.75,0.19,0.00,1.13,0.19,0.38,0.00,0.38,0.00,8.29,2.82,1.13,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.38,1.51,0.19,1.51,0.56

Her faade is unshakeable and unemotional.  The only person who can get through to Savannah Cyborg, as she is called behind her back, is Matt Kensington.  He makes her furious more often that not, but Savannah has to admit that Matt has never lied to her and she trusts that he never will.  Invited to a late night meeting to discuss a business opportunity, Savannah has no idea that the opportunity is her body and the business is what happens when Matt and his four trusted advisors make her body sing.  With touches of fire Savannah is brought to the brink of ecstasy and then some, but what happens when her ropes are untied?Matt loved Savannah and because of this love, he knows he has to do something drastic to get her attention.  I like his personality very much - dominate without being overbearing and just enough tenderness that Savannah knows without a doubt that he wants her.  Savannah was tough to get to a handle on.  Her upbringing alone is enough to make even the nicest woman hesitant and while Savannah uses sarcasm often with Matt, it isn't enough for Matt not to know what she is covering up - her emotions.Board Resolution by Joey W. Hill is a BDSM novel that will push your buttons, but make you think.  Add in an uber sexy hero and his band of four fiery hot brothers and the results are wicked.

Let's see, a 35 year old virgin goes to a board meeting and for the most part is either raped by the members of the board or coerced through bondage to have sex (of some kind) with each of them.  So! What's not to like, huh?  My God, is this what women of today aspire to?  Do you actually enjoy reading about a woman trussed up like a cow at a rodeo who is then experimented on by guys with different fetishes? This woman doesn't know she is about to become the center of attention, so to speak, and is certainly not happy with her forced entry into BDSM, yet our wonderful story teller continues with her tale.Matt, the CEO, has rigged up a machine which suspends a woman while fully restraining her at the same time.  With this fantastic device, which just happens to be installed in the board room, he can show our female protagonist just how much he and his fellow board members ""love"" her.I am appalled that the author would have you believe the average woman on the streets would enjoy this type of depravity and would, in fact, state her undying love for her antagonist.  The book has errors and omissions, but the real problem with this type of nonsense is that it gives the impression that if you are a large, dominant, sexually attractive male you can do what you want with a woman and, no matter how weird it is, they will love you for it.  GIVE ME STRENGTH!!!  Look, what you do in the bedroom with your spouse or lover is your business, and if you want to beat each other senseless while having consensual sex, Okay.  Just remember, coerced sex isn't consensual sex; it's rape.  Just because this book is fiction doesn't excuse its implications.  Honey!  Where's my two-by-four???

The ideal of woman being all that strong with only weak men around really didn't thrill me.  I'm a strong woman, but I want my man to be a man, not some weakling.  Luckily this book didn't disappoint.  Once I got past my preconceived conceptions of the book, I got into it and I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.  I didn't want to put it down.  The final decision is that I enjoyed the book and am anxious to read book two of the series.Don't be put off by the so called bloody scenes some described.  Yes, there's some death, but the author didn't dwell on it.  In fact, nothing was dwelled on, which I really appreciate. It was fast moving, but you could keep track of what was happening.  I didn't once start skipping over sentences or paragraphs as I have with other author's books.  You'll want to read every word.Romantic, sexy, steamy scenes?  Yes, there's that too in this book.  I do love a good romance novel with an actual plot and some good action.As far as some other comments about the lack of background...I just shake my head.  I don't need a whole book on why something is, this is fiction.  Get over it.  Enjoy the book and the story it contains.  The story wasn't about what happened 500 years ago from the beginning of this book, it's a story about Candice, Angel, Daniel, Baker and the Network.

Not understanding of those that need to snipe about non-leather things especially if it looks good. (Those that have money to burn apparently) The double stitched border looks professional and high quality. When reading the review on this product to decide on blowing $40 or $25 I concentrated on the middle of the road reviews on the magnetic Amazon model. I want to know the absolute worst thing I should be aware of and its repetition is the only thing that I can depend on for any possible truth from my consumer perspective. The majority of the 5 star people I had to assume would be predisposed to give it a great review to justify their expenditure. In the mediocre reviews I always look for consistency of the mediocre complaint. If there is no consistency, there is a good chance that simply kavetching of picky perfectionists are more the order of the day and the item is actually a top notch purchase.The Amazon Cover model consisted of three main complaints. Very consistent! One, it was pretty expensive for the simply acceptable but definitely adequate quality. Two, the magnetic closure was many times not 100%. It didn't close completely all the time, or it did not turn off the unit as designed. Third, it seemed heavy. There were consistent variations of these themes.The MarBlue on the other hand has awesome reviews, even the mediocre reviews did not have the repetitive problem that makes my red flags go up. The hand hold was a universal plus. Now that I have it, I agree, the hand hold strap is fantastic and brings an entirely new dimension of reading with this unit for in bed nightime use. The Amazon unit also had its weight highlighted several times while MarBlue did not. I can now vouch for the most acceptable weight of the MarBlue. My Kindle White is held most securely by four corner elastic straps. The hand hold strap is solid and sturdy looking and appears capable of lasting for the life of the product.If you do not have a leather fetish, the appearance of this cover is more than appealing. One complaint mentioned is its sensitivity to indentation or whatever. I do not experience that sensitivity. The faux leather is definitely not jelly bean consistency. It's solid and beautiful as long as you don't abuse it. The protection of the integrity of the Kindle is excellent. I feel as if I dropped it from even waist or table height, no damage would result. I recommend this item especially for the price. Based on the Amazon cover reviews since I physically don't have one to handle, I don't discern any step down in quality as long as you don't value the auto off/on feature.",473,A3MMVTD7DA3PJ8,"Jeez, what more dya' want?",5,5.0,478,74.46,19.56,34.56,65.41,16.48,20.92,83.47,52.72,11.72,4.81,3.97,0.00,0.63,0.00,0.21,6.90,9.62,12.76,9.00,4.39,5.44,3.14,13.39,5.02,2.93,0.42,2.51,2.51,5.02,3.56,1.46,0.00,0.21,0.00,2.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.44,2.93,1.88,2.09,4.39,2.09,4.39,5.23,2.30,0.00,2.72,2.30,1.05,0.42,0.21,0.63,4.39,0.00,1.67,1.05,1.05,0.84,2.72,10.04,0.00,9.41,0.84,5.44,2.93,2.72,0.00,0.21,1.05,0.00,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.00,11.72,6.49,2.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.00,1.26,0.42,0.84

It looks good, it holds the Paperwhite very securely, and it has a little magnet that serves double duty - keeping the cover securely closed and activating the AutoWake feature of the Paperwhite.The Marblue Atlas cover appears to be well made and durable enough to last for years of service. The faux leather looks good, and the stitching is uniform and tight. It doesn't have a magnetic lock like the Amazon cover has, but the elastic bungee will keep the cover securely closed when you're not reading. And the wide hand strap is a nice touch for hand-holding the Kindle.But I have two concerns about this case:1. The Kindle is secured in the case with four elastic straps. That's okay, but straps can break, although these seem tough enough. However, I much prefer a more secure plastic snap-in shell like the Amazon case has.2. A bigger concern is the lack of a magnet to activate the newer Kindles' AutoWake feature. AutoWake is a great feature that lets you avoid fumbling for the on/off switch every time you use the Kindle.Overall, the Marblue Atlas is a nice case.

The reader fits securely in its retaining straps and the case is held shut by an elastic band. I do wonder, though, how long the elastic will hold up under constant use; I will update this review when and if the strap gives out. The case also has an interesting elasticized sleeve that allows you to fold the cover of the case back and slide your hand into the sleeve for secure handling. The sleeve is somewhat awkward for me to use, but it has been only a few days that I have been using it and it provides piece of mind if you are reading on the train or subway and are prone to doze while reading. I have also noticed that the sleeve and fabric cover of the case imparts an unpleasant odor to the hand when it is inserted into the sleeve for any period of time. I hope that it will pass in time, as it is quite noticeable. I had been using a sleeve/pouch to transport my Kindle while commuting or traveling, and I find this case to be more convenient to use in that you do not have to find a place to stow your pouch while reading. That being noted, I think that the padding on my present pouch would provide more protection to the Kindle if dropped while stored. I would rate this case a 7 out of 10.Update: January 12, 2014 - some time has now passed and I am more happy with this Kindle case! The scent about which I complained has largely gone and I am more comfortable using (or not using) the strap for my hand. I am still somewhat skeptical about the long-term survivability of the elastic strap on the outside of the case.Update: June 11, 2014 - This product has really grown on me.

These are decent cases and have some good things going for them. I wouldn't say they're great cases but they do the job with, what I consider, only a few flaws.The system for attaching your Kindle to the cover are four very strong and quite tight rubber reinforced elastic cords. I've had several Kindles and numerous cases over the years and as far as four corner case mounts this is the most secure of that style I've ever seen. I had my PaperWhite mounted in this case and shook it violently, over a pillow and ready to catch it should anything happen, and not only did it stay in place it didn't move a fraction of an inch. I was very impressed with that function of the case.The case exterior is a synthetic leather that truly looks and feels like leather. It is well made, and fairly handsome. Unlike many synthetic products this had no harsh chemical smell. The blue cover looks a little less like leather than the black but it is a very nice shade of blue.The interior is an attractive, and soft, dark grey microfiber that's quite pleasing to the touch.The case is held closed or open with a half inch wide cloth elastic that is well attached to the case. This holds the case closed quite well. The hinge area of the case is a bit too large/tall/wide making the case when folded back a little ungainly and if not strapped down it wanted to flop closed.Inside the case is a nearly three inch wide strap made of the same soft, grey microfiber attached with elastics at both the top and bottom. This comes into use when the case is open you can put your hand or fingers under this strap to read one handed. With my PaperWhite I found this to be slightly uncomfortable making me arch my hand in an odd manner to get my thumb onto the screen. I'm not a fan of the strap, the sections at the top and bottom where it's stitched to the elastic create two lumps that sit directly on the Kindle's screen. They're soft but it's two unnecessary pressure points.This case does not have the magnet that the Amazon brand case does that turns the kindle on and off when you open it. The power button on my PaperWhite was a little hard to reach with the shape of the case and the location of the mounting strap. It wasn't too difficult to use but it's nowhere near as easy as opening the case and having your Kindle come on.In conclusion...The case is decent. It's a little... gappy, the front cover bends when you have your hand in the strap and this creates a gap that will let debris into the case and onto your Kindle. I'm not crazy about the strap but that's more personal preference than anything else. This is a well made decently protective Kindle case.",506,A1MCH5RXDOH87H,A Solid Four Star Item,5,3.0,516,75.47,34.19,53.41,69.60,24.57,11.63,82.75,53.88,12.40,4.84,2.91,0.00,1.55,0.00,0.39,7.56,11.82,11.82,9.30,4.07,6.78,1.94,15.50,7.95,3.10,1.16,1.36,1.94,5.23,3.68,1.36,0.58,0.19,0.00,2.91,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.88,0.97,1.94,1.16,2.33,0.78,3.68,6.01,2.52,0.19,3.10,1.16,0.97,0.19,0.00,0.00,3.68,0.00,0.78,2.13,0.58,0.58,3.10,10.27,0.39,15.12,1.74,12.40,1.36,1.36,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.78,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.78,0.00,11.82,6.40,1.94,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.10,0.00,0.39

The Amazon cover has a magnet which secures the case closed while the MarBlue cover has an elastic strap to keep the book closed. The Amazon cover automatically turns the kindle on and off when the cover is opened or closed while the Marblue cover does not.The cover is sturdy enough and folds open for one handed reading. There is a handy strap which keeps the flap secure when reading one handed which is better than the amazon leather cover. Also, there is a hand strap which makes one handed reading easier than the Amazon cover.The MarBlue cover weighs less than the amazon leather cover which is nicer when reading one handed.Overall, I would say that the MarBlue cover for the Paperwhite is better for reading one handed but the Amazon leather cover is higher quality fit and finish.If you find this review helpful please give it a thumbs up below.

The only difference is some versions have a ""Wisdom of the East"" recommended reading list at the end.  You can Google a better list.  So, only buy the $0 Kindle version.If you are an adult, with a self examined life experience of moral reasoning, you won't learn anything new from Ptah Hotep.  However, that it is the oldest book still in print, and may inscribe your personal moral code, validated by a sage of ancient ages - means it is worth reading, makes it a `keeper' for your library.  A definition of ""sanity"" is: reality commonly experienced.  This book, if you agree with its prescripts, will provide you with the comfort of being in the lived majority of any time.  While I am hesitant to condone majority morality, here presented is Common Sense Morality, subjectively derived from living in society, four thousand years ago, and still valid today.Sharing my personal saga, I first heard of this book in the 1990's.  I visioned acquiring the wisdom of the Ages.  Disappointedly, no printed edition of this book was available at bookstores.  There were select universities with rare copies, as University of Chicago's Oriental Library.  But, tho a USC graduate, I didn't have reciprocal privileges at UC.  Knowledge denied.

Kindle Fire may be a decent option, but I haven't tried it.________________________Science News is put out by the Society for Science & the Public. As far as the nature of Science News, it is a good quality way to keep up with updates in various fields, but it does not go into tremendous depth, and the articles are not written by scientists. Scientific American has articles written by scientists through more than half the magazine, each article can be 6-8 pages long, and may be more in depth than many would like.  Though I personally like reading articles written by the actual scientists, Scientific American has undergone many changes, causing the quality to fluctuate in unpleasant ways. For this reason, I would suggest that Science News is better for the layman that wants to just keep a light touch on various scientific fields, and perhaps even for the scientist that wants to keep just as light a touch on fields not their own. Though the short articles are not written by scientists, the writers get information from scientists and many science journals.The publication is issued every two weeks now, rather than the former weekly rate it had for many years. With the print publication, one gets access to the publication online, can access it wherever there is internet access, and this includes years of past issues, but I have found when subscribing to the print issue, I would rarely access the online version.The Kindle format in general is pretty good, and if a color illustration is necessary, the illustrations, as well as all of the content, are available online for free (something rarely available for free with Scientific American).

In other words, a movie you can view instantly today, may not be available for instant viewing tomorrow, or next week. However, if they get reviewed early enough in their ""Instant View Run,"" then it can still remain a timely blog. Also, even though a movie might not be available for Instant View, it should still be available for DVD Mailing, which comes with most accounts.This blog contains ""mini-reviews"" of each movie. As you can tell with my reviews, I like short, concise opinions without a lot of long, drawn-out commentary, which can inadvertantly include spoilers. The downside is that, at times, the `review' portions of the posts are a little too short, not really giving a good idea of the reviewer's opinion. The newer posts appear to be including a little more opinion, though, so as this is a relatively new blog, it seems like the author's coming out of his shell.The rating system leaves something to be desired. There are three `ratings' a movie can receive: Watch, Pass, or Avoid. From what I can tell, ""Watch"" is the only rating where a person would actually watch a movie. ""Pass"" and ""Avoid"" seem to equate to ""Bad"" and ""Awful,"" respectively. I know there are reviewers who just use a thumbs up or thumbs down, but I prefer a more in-depth rating system.Mr. Hassler has ""Theme Weeks"" where he reviews specific types/genres of movies. Also, he featured a week of explanation of the different ways you can watch Netflix movies and other articles like that which were very informative.Timeliness: 5 StarsPosts are made daily and seem to be on a regular time schedule. I say ""seem to be"" because I didn't check it every hour or anything to see exactly when each post was made. However, when I checked each day, there was a new post already available.Online Version: 3 StarsIn the Online Version of a Kindle Blog, I look for two major criteria:1. Am I missing something if I only read the Kindle version? The answer to that is ""No"". Even though the blog is about movies, there are not a bunch of video clips that you would miss out on if you don't check the online version all the time.2. Organization. Sure, the Kindle version is great, but if I want to go look at older posts, how easy is it? This blog fails here. The Categories are badly done. Some are Actors/Actress names. Some are movie titles. Still others are just miscellaneous things I would never think to search for. I think it would have been terrific had there been some Genre categories for simpler searching.With a Kindle Blog, I don't want to feel that I have to go online to get the full content, but I do want to be able to go there and easily search for articles I may have missed or want to read again.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsThe Editing and Formatting are both of professional quality.Rating: PG - Some of the movie descriptions may have a little Adult subject matter.",531,A22Z3RZ040GL35,4 1/4 Stars,3,4.25,547,56.82,24.92,62.14,25.77,21.88,17.37,85.74,51.55,10.42,5.30,3.47,0.00,0.91,0.55,0.37,5.12,7.31,11.15,10.79,7.50,6.03,1.83,17.00,4.39,2.19,1.83,1.83,2.93,3.29,1.65,1.65,0.37,0.00,0.73,3.84,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.55,16.27,2.74,1.10,2.74,5.67,1.10,6.22,3.66,3.29,0.18,0.18,0.37,0.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.38,0.00,0.37,0.73,0.91,0.73,2.56,14.26,1.28,13.71,2.01,4.75,6.76,2.74,4.57,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.66,5.85,6.03,1.28,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.73,4.02,1.28,0.00,1.10

Puck and Ash have to take something from the Summer Queen, Titania, and make it out alive...somehow.I really loved getting Puck's POV in this novella. His sarcasm and wit always made me smile, but getting into his head showed that his personality is much deeper than being a jokster. The internal struggle for him after a visit from the Summer King, Oberon, amped up the tension and suspense in what Puck would ultimately decided to do with the prince who stole the heart of his beloved Meghan. Definitely a heart-pounder!Josh Hurley did an awesome job narrating Puck. His voice was smooth and perfect for the pranking Puck.

Bryant:Medicine Mix-up had me laughing.Shattered by Ali Cross:She better love him back.Before by Jessie Harrell:Who would turn down Eros?The Qualm Before the Storm by Karen Amanda Hooper:Just kidnap her and leave.Unspeakable by S.R. Johannes:Full of mystery, major cliffhanger!In the Beginning by Katie Klein:I want my own guardian!A Chance Encounter by Cheri Lasota:Where is this girl going?Family Bonds by Heather McCorkle:Definitely worth breaking the rules.Getting Closer by Lisa Nowak:A sensitive guy, how refreshing.Precalculus by Cory Putman Oakes:Math SHOULD be that exciting!The Almost Assassin by Laura Pauling:Who would taze a mime?Mind Games by Susan Kaye Quinn:Don't they believe in privacy?By The Firelight by Elle Strauss:Do NOT mess with Casey.A Very Alien Valentine's Day by Magan Vernon:Aliens have some serious class.Aligned by RaShelle Workman:Makes saving souls look easy.So there they are, my initial reactions.  I hope this sparks some curiosity as to exactly what these stories are about.  What?  Need more convincing?  Fine.  Since you asked so nicely, I will share my thoughts on this anthology as a whole.  Ahem...I have never been one to read anthologies; I think this is because I form an emotional attachment to the characters, and then BOOM they're gone.  That said, this book is wonderful.  As in, curl up on the couch, grab a cup of tea, and daydream about these guys after reading all their stories.  All of the short stories are from the guys' POV.  It's a very refreshing change from the normal, female protagonist approach.  With all of these amazing guys, the biggest challenge is simply choosing your favorite crush!  One thing that I really love about In His Eyes is that I still understand and connect with the short stories, deleted scenes, and prequels that are associated with books that I haven't read yet.  Each of the authors does an amazing job of tying me to the characters and, when needed, providing background information to help set up the stories.  All of these short stories are very well written and have a definite flow making them easy to read.Another quality that makes this book so amazing is its diversity.  All of these stories are YA fiction, but some of them are contemporary, some are paranormal, some are fantasy, a few are sci-fi, and I even classify one as historical.  With all of these different genres, there is  sure to be a perfect story for just about anyone's taste.The cover:Well lets see: this cover is steamy.  Just look at the heart, it screams romance.  I really love how the guy and girl are looking at one another through the heart in the mirror as they are leaning in for a kiss. They don't even seem to be aware of a mirror between them.  So romantic.  I hope they both get that kiss!Basically, I absolutely LOVE In His Eyes and recommend it to anyone who loves YA, yummy guys, mystery, and a whole lot of romance!I give it 5 out of 5 stars.Check out more of my reviews at EpilogueReview on Blogspot",578,A1YN02HGNWTPT,A Wonderful Read for All Occasions,6,5.0,601,77.01,67.92,17.14,97.76,24.04,19.30,82.53,50.58,13.31,7.15,3.83,0.17,0.67,1.00,1.50,6.16,6.49,15.64,6.99,6.16,4.66,1.16,13.14,6.49,2.33,1.66,1.66,3.99,7.32,6.32,1.00,0.00,0.17,0.17,10.48,0.17,1.50,0.83,1.66,10.65,1.66,1.83,1.33,2.66,2.16,1.66,2.33,1.16,0.67,0.17,2.50,1.00,0.33,0.00,0.50,5.99,3.00,0.83,1.33,1.16,0.17,1.33,9.82,1.00,10.48,1.33,5.99,3.33,2.33,1.16,0.33,0.33,0.17,0.33,1.16,0.00,0.67,0.33,0.33,0.00,18.80,6.16,4.83,3.00,0.17,1.00,1.33,0.50,0.33,1.50,0.00,0.00

Since each came with a 14-day free trial, I tried out a bunch of them.Two magazines that have been published for decades surprised me by having a number of lame stories, while eFiction surprised me by ONLY having a couple of lame stories. eFiction's content was on par with some of the best genre mags available, and when I learned that its content is currently all by unpaid writers, developed and polished by volunteer readers and editors, I thought to myself, ""Here is a new thing under the sun.""I also kept my subscription. I love good short stories and this has plenty of them. I'm happy to pay $3 or so per issue for the long-established fantasy and science fiction magazines, but I feel even better about the $1.99 for eFiction because I'm supporting something innovative that's interesting in and of itself. The very process by which so much excellent writing emerges from the independent publishing world is fascinating to behold. The community shares news of rising authors and good stories and acts as a new machine to thresh out the chaff and present the reading public with superior work.I hesitated slightly before choosing how many stars to rank this magazine.

Resigned to the fringes of the popular factions, being more a sweatshirt and comics than sling backs and coach kind of girl. Maybe her tastes in outside appearance is a nod to her difference. Gwen has a Gypsy gift of psychometry, she is able to touch something enabling her to see glimpses and feel emotions of the people who have come into contact with it.First Frost is set about six months prior Touch of Frost and, details the events leading up to Gwen's entrance to Mythos Academy. I am a fan of Estep and have been patiently waiting for this series to drop and snatched this up as soon as I came across it. Immediately after finishing First Frost I went on the authors site to see if any chapters of Touch of Frost were posted. The first two chapters are available and were a factor in my assessment of this teaser.So while I like what I've read so far, in general the concept is really interesting, with a lot of potential. I like the idea of a school for warrior whiz kids. But I was disappointed. First Frost was more of a prologue than a novella. The story wasn't enough for me to think of this as anything more than an introduction. It was insightful and left me wanting more. It didn't cost much, so I don't feel cheated. My real problem is with the inconsistencies between this and the full book. Of course in Touch of Frost the explanations of Gwen's gift and past are included, but she unknowingly caught the vision that starts everything. Though in First Frost she planned it. There were other little things that didn't match. I just find that the lack of consistency turns First Frost into a half-hearted effort.I am still looking forward to this series. You don't need to read this, It's not vital, but if you like little shorts and want a summary of Gwen's life before Mythos you'll love it. And the price isn't bad for what it is.

Even though First Frost is barely an hour's read, it left me sputtering and muttering for three times as long. My fingers are sore of making annotations on my Kindle. Behold, my opinion of this little piece of work.Ms Estep is writing in dangerous territory. Writing about a school for special kids with magical powers is tricky business; it automatically reminds of other successful YA-series that follow this formula. Series like Harry Potter, House of Night, Vampire Academy, Fallen... Just to name a few. Because of this, an author's work, how original it might be, just looks like a fake. Like the author thought, hey, this is popular, let's write something like that!I'm quite sure Ms Estep didn't think like that when she came up with the Mythos Academy. It's quite evident that she put some thought in it; the school inhabits all different kinds of mythological creatures. Even though myths (yes, that is my newly invented abbreviation of mythological creatures) seem to be the new angels (like angels were the new vampires... etcetera), it's still a fairly new sub-genre, so definitely nothing clich&eacute; there.Now let's talk about what made my face go ""No you didn't!"". For educational purposes I will add some quotes from the book so you can see what I'm talking about.We start our little story with our heroine in the locker room at school. We immediately get introduced to her special powers.""I was a Gypsy with psychometry magic. A fancy way of saying that I saw images in my head and got flashes of other people's memories and feelings off almost everything that I touched.""Well, that sounds pretty cool right? It definitely has a lot of mystery potential, where Gwen uncovers secrets using her powers. The Gypsy part makes me frown a bit. But we're still on the second page, I guess that we will get more info about that later.We go through a bit of explanation of her powers, and I am still in happy YA land. Celine is content.""Yeah, I was just that kind of loser, a book-smart Gypsy girl who sucked at pretty much every sport you could think of and probably a couple that hadn't even been invented yet.""Huh. There is the Gypsy thing again. Still have no idea what all that's about, but I guess we'll see. I'm a bit annoyed though that we have another awkward and clumsy heroine here. Why can't they just be mediocre at sports? Do they always have to be get a ball in their face? Even though I personally am as clumsy as every awkward book geek, I don't find it an endearing trait in a main character. Let us continue.Something bad and freaky happens. It actually had quite a shock-factor, which I enjoyed. Gwen's reaction to said bad thing:""And that's when I started screaming.I screamed and screamed and screamed.""Okay that is pretty awful. I'm sorry, but I'm not one for repeating the same word over and over again. I'm a fan of synonyms. Or descriptions. I find this quite lame.A few pages later we meet Gwen's mother.""Concern Filled my mom's eyes. She was a Gypsy just like me, which meant that she had a gift like me.""Now this awkward. The logical conclusion of this sentence is that a person that is a Gypsy, must have a gift. I still don't get the definition of Gypsy here. Call me racist, but I always thought Gypsies were those people that live in trailers and travel around the world with their families. So isn't it quite obvious that Gwen's mother would be a Gypsy if Gwen herself was one? Seriously, at this point I feel like I'm missing out on some secret pact that Gypsy from now on is a code name for a supernatural person, like witch.A little bit bewildered, I continue reading. Enter grandma. Guess what, she's a Gypsy.""...the same violet color as her eyes-as all our eyes were.""Now that is freaky. Grandmother, mother & daughter all have violet (?) eyes. First, I have never seen a person with eyes that could be considered violet, but even if we completely disregard the fact of people with purple eyecolor, I think it's disconcerting that three generations have EXACTLY the same eye colour. But oh well, this is urban-fantasy, so I'll go with it. For now.There is some family talk, some ""oh my god, my mother is so weird, she always talks about Greek gods and goddesses!"". Yeah, yeah, we get that. Pretty standard stuff. Unless your mother talks about killer unicorns, I'm not that interested. We talk about volcanoes and quantum mechanics at dinner. Get over yourself please.Now we arrive at the most offensive sentence of the whole story.""I didn't know then that this would be the last time I ever talked to her.""Oh COME ON! Seriously, this is not cool. You do not do something like this. This completely ruins the surprise in a horrible way. Really, I can't even begin to tell you how I feel about dropping such an important part of the story just seconds after an uneventful phone call. No dramatical build-up whatsoever. BOOM, hey, my mother will disappear/die! Ugh.Let's examine dear Gwen's reaction when she finds out the bad news that she will never speak her mother again.""I had started screaming again.""Figures.Insert some self guilt.""And cried and cried and cried some more.""Are you kidding me? There is really nothing more to say than ""verb and verb and verb some more""?! Use it once, and I will be forgiving. Use it twice in a twenty page story and I will begin to doubt if you even put some effort into this. And if this story has ever seen an editor. Or a proof reader.Now, we come to the Harry Potter-style part. A mysterious Professor arrives at the house.""She was short, with a body that looked stocky and strong inside her black pantsuit and white shirt. Her black hair was pulled back into a bun, and her eyes were a soft green behind her silver glasses.""Right. Give her robes and grey hair, and who have we gotten here?... That's right, Professor McGonagall! And there is more, look what she has to say!""Because Mythos isn't just any school, Gwen,"" Metis said. ""It's for kids like you. Kids with magic.""You're a wizard Harry!Oops, wrong book.Our ever eloquent heroine has some questions for McGonagall.""What kinds of kids go there?"" I asked. ""What kind of magic do they have? Are they Gypsies like me?""Well, DUH. Every kid with magic is a witch! Or wait, you call that Gypsy. Wait, now I am confused.McGonagall vaguely answers""It varies, depending on the student and her background. But the Vikings and Valkyries are very strong, while the Romans and Amazons are very quick.""Ahhh, that's how the Roman empire was so successful! They were QUICK! So when they were fighting Asterix and Obelix in France, they would just go like, oh-my-god-we-capture-your-land-so-quickly-it's-so-quick-you-didn't-even-see-us-coming! And the Vikings were just like ARRGG, I'm strong. I'm gonna hit you in the head with my big axe, I'm so strong. And Valkyries, that usually are pictured with wings, they're not quick! Nope, they're just strong. Like tanks. With wings.How can you take this seriously.Now, enter the super cool classes at Mythos.""Myth-history?"" I asked. ""What kind of class is that?""Well dear, supposedly ""booksmart"" girl, it's a CLASS in which you learn about MYTHS. It's a very hard to grasp concept. I wouldn't understand it either. I looked it up on Wikipedia.McGonagall thinks it's still a mystery though.""Metis just smiled. ""You'll see, Gwen. You'll see."" ""I guess she will see.""Almost like... she'd known my mom or something. But that just wasn't possible. I'd known all of my mom's friends, and Metis wasn't one of them.""It's absolutely IMPOSSIBLE that your mother knows someone you don't! You know every single person in her life, from the moment she was born up until now! I bet she has like, big photobooks with their pictures to keep track of them. Must be hard work to keep up with all the mail men.Gonna skip a part here, otherwise this rant will last forever.Mythos looks spooky, blah blah blah. They have Minotaur statues, big deal.EVERY SINGLE KID HERE IS LIKE SUPER DUPER RICH AND THEY ALL WEAR LIKE DESIGNER CLOTHES AND PLATINUM WATCHES AND DIAMONDS.I don't make that up. It's in there.""I hadn't quite believed Metis when she'd claimed there were other kids out there like me, kids who could do amazing things, but now I was seeing it for myself.""You have frigging magical grandma, and you don't believe someone else can have some powers too? No comment.Then there is super awesome guy that fights with swords. And please sit down now because this might be shocking;""He noticed me staring at him and gave me a slow, suggestive wink. Was he... was he flirting with me? He didn't even know me.""No he DIDN'T! A guy that flirts with the new girl! That HAS NEVER EVER HAPPENED BEFORE!I'm going to skip to the last line though. There is some more mindless babbling that really isn't that interesting any more.""One thing was certain-my life was never, ever going to be the same.""I agree.

The March issue was a week late; to Amazon's credit, they did refund the charge for that month.But I was in Market Basket yesterday, and saw the April 2012 issue on their magazine rack.  Guess where it isn't?  If you guessed, ""my Kindle"", you win a cookie.

BTW, this is the only magazine I have this problem with, the others I subscribe to always show up on time.Now, let's get onto the actual content of this magazine.  Do they even test these recipes, or is there just sloppy editing?  I decided to try the crockpot white bean & ham soup recipe in the March issue.  Let me tell you that if you made this recipe to the letter, you'd be nomming on beans and carrots that are barely cooked.  Not tasty.  First of all, they did NOT instruct the cook to soak the dried beans first.  I chose to soak anyway.  Also, they claimed that the soup would be done in five hours when cooked on LOW in a crockpot.  I allowed some extra time, still not done.

This phone was for text messaging, making calls and as an emergency back up phone for the last ten plus years.  We have never replaced the battery, needed to replace any parts, or needed any type of servicing.  This phone still works like it did the day is was purchased.  The battery stays charged for days, the screen is still clear and the signal strength is still great.About a year ago, we gave this phone to our ten-year-old son to use as an emergency only phone.  It has worked beautifully and managed to prove his readiness for a real cell phone.I know that it has been dropped countless times, ran over by the family Jeep, and left in the car on a summer day with 100 plus temperatures, dropped in the sand, rained on and several other countless acts of abuse.  Yet, the phone still survives.If this model is still available, I recommend it to anyone.  To our surprise, it has been through more troubled times than a Hollywood marriage and it still works like new.

I just found that the paper generally found its way to the recycle pile without having had much more than a glance at the headlines on the front page and a maybe few of the sections.When I got my Kindle earlier this year I took advantage of the 14 day free trial and have been a happy subscriber ever since.  It is very convenient to read in many situations where reading the print edition would be awkward or inappropriate.  I find scanning the articles much easier to do on the Kindle than the paper edition.My new morning routine involves quickly scanning the article list for each section and if it looks interesting I open the article and then bookmark it.  Then throughout the day when opportunities arrive, I can go back and read the bookmarked articles.

The paper has gone downhill: the writing has suffered, analysis is almost gone, and the paper has become more and more biased.  While the navigation is good, the Kindle version frequently has typos, and it will refer you to the website Post for many interesting articles which are clipped short.  As I am a local, I expect the Post to also cover local news, but it is deficient in what it selects.  There are some major issues going on, but they prefer to go back to some crime that is unsolved and happened years ago rather than dig into current issues--it's probably cheaper.  The Post covers politics, but the reporting is typically he said, she said with little or no research or analysis, and the editorial and news selection slant is decidedly pro-illegal immigrant.  I am not a conservative, but I would like more balanced reporting regardless of what the editorial board has to say.  To be fair, the Post occasionally has a fact checker article that is useful. For the last several months, I've found myself skipping over the much of the paper.  Many of the writers have an annoying habit of launching into an article, but failing to give you the key information until the last couple of paragraphs.  I suppose that is to peak my interest or something, but it's like listening to Bolero.  I am in the process of cancelling the subscription.  By all means, try a free subscription though.

We fell in love with the reach of the news, covering not just the DC area but overseas as well.  When we returned to Tucson we missed having the breadth of The Washington Post available, and were not able to receive the Post here.  When I found it was available on the Kindle I bought both the Kindle and a subscription within the hour.  I have been thrilled with both ever since.  I love getting up in the morning, turning on my Kindle and telling my husband, ""the paper's here"" without getting dressed or even leaving the house.  Because of the time difference, if either of us is up in the middle of the night, we often get the Post hours before our local paper is delivered.

No more forgetting to gather your paper as you leave the house, no more going outside in the rain and hoping your paper isn't soaked -- you get the idea.Also good:  It's much better than trying to read the Post on your iPhone or Blackberry.  No connection issues, and the type is so much easier to read.The bad:  Holy cow this edition has a ton of typos in it.  Does no one at the Post proofread their work before sending it in?  A couple of weeks ago, I read a whole Thomas Boswell column where everyother wordwas mashedtogether.  Last week, I read a profile of a chef in the Food Section, then I started reading the same article again, because the Post had reprinted another copy of the article right behind the first one.  And the series about the national anti-terrorism bureaucracy was apparently printed in code.The bad:  Why so few pictures?  You get a couple, but often, you will read a caption for a picture that you can't see.  Huh?More bad:  No comics or editorial cartoons.  Why not?  The Kindle can do it; my version of the New Yorker shows all the cartoons.  Why don't I get it in the Post?Even more bad:  The price.  I could subscribe to the real paper, which costs money to print and deliver, for about $10/month.  Instead, I'm paying $12/month for a version of the paper without pictures, comics, coupons, or proofreading -- which is odd, because the Kindle version costs nothing to print or deliver.Having said all that, the convenience of getting the Post on my Kindle will probably keep me subscribing until a better option presents itself.

If I switch from print (I'm currently a print subscriber of each) to Kindle on both, I go a long way to paying for the Kindle (both result in a $100/year savings on the Kindle). The WSJ is a relatively easy decision to switch to Kindle. Why? It's not photo intensive and I don't care about losing all the stock, etc tables. And the Kindle feed does do some photos (well, in fact). The Tribune is a harder decision. As a daily city paper, photos are an important part of the paper. And with the Kindle edition there's no photos. Partly, I suppose, because the Kindle doesn't do color (front page and sports) and partly because the Tribune finds it easier to remove them from the Kindle feed then to properly integrate them in. With the Kindle feed of the Tribune, all you get is the text. You also lose ads,coupons, cartoons and cross word puzzles. I'm not a big ad person so all I'm really losing is the weekly supermarket ads. And nowadays, you can easily get them online at the stores' websites. As far as cartoons, since For Better for for Worse is now in permanent re-runs, I'm not missing anything (and if I was, I'm sure I can find them online).So for me the decision will boil down to how much do I want photos with my Tribune.  The other missing items aren't that important to me, it's the photos or lack there of which will drive my decision as to whether I switch to the Kindle from paper for the Tribune. If I do go to Kindle, I'll be losing something I value. The question will be are photos worth a $100/year.

However, there are a number of flaws that haven't been corrected yet, including:- Most columns do not have a byline (even after being told this would be corrected, it isn't 100%)- Accompanying articles are out of order- General formatting (e.g. lists)- Occasionally items are clearly missing (e.g. 'Here are 5 items ...' and then the 5 items are missing)- US/World blurbs do not identify the state or countryIt's clear the formatting of the Kindle edition of the Tribune needs some work -- the Tribune needs to understand how the reader views the articles and format them accordingly.

It still covers Baltimore and the region well enough, but there's little national or international coverage. The Monday and Tuesday editions are hardly worth the paper they're printed on. And this is where Kindle is such a magnificent device. Why waste the paper and ink, not to mention the delivery driver's gas, when the paper can be easily read on a Kindle? With a subscription, the paper's right there waiting for you when you wake up; no need to drudge out into the rain or cold. If you're getting the Sun, it might as well be by Kindle. I've seen no discrepancy in what I see in Kindle as opposed to what's in the printed edition; I even get an additional section (Howard County once a week, in addition to Anne Arundel, not that I read that section). By having the Kindle subscription, I also have a sense that I'm contributing to keeping the paper alive by paying for the subscription as opposed to reading it for free online.

When I found out that I could subscribe to the electronic versions of these papers, I jumped at the chance to have these two delivered to my Kindle. I had been reading the Post on my Kindle for about three months, and only subscribed to the Sun within the past week for more local news, but I've already cancelled my subscription to the Sun. Why? I've only been able to compare it to the Kindle edition of the Washington Post, but the overall feel of the material is markedly different between these two periodicals. I know that the Sun has gone through a redesign or two since we last subscribed to the paper version, so I'm not sure if it's an attempt to carry over the style of the paper to this new medium, but it's very odd to see some links for headlines and items as ""Typical Capitalized Headlines"", while links for other items are in ""entirely lowercase text""; it's a bit distracting to see the style flip-flop so often. Content wasn't as structured (national / local / business / etc.), and felt like articles were mixed in together, so the overall flow was a bit weird -- I never really had an idea of which section I was in at the time. Finally, even though it's pointed out how certain syndicated content wouldn't be included, was there really a need to include things like the intro to the sudoku puzzle even when the sudoku puzzle itself was excluded?

This happened a couple weeks ago while I was traveling. It happened many times during the past several months.I've always thought Kindle is flawed, but I bought many because I think e-ink is the right technology for reading whereas a lighting-up screen like iPad and KindleFire is wrong for reading.To the end, Amazon really disappointed me. Amazon has not improved the e-ink technology at all. Instead, it has gradually made it unstable, slow, and interruptive to reading. Many updates of the Kindle focus on commercial goals rather than improvement of reading experience.I've decided to stop all my Kindle subscriptions now and throw away all the kindle books I have purchased. This decision is after about 5 years of efforts to love Kindle.Good-buy.=========My old review=========I subscribed the Kindle version for a short period. I think the pricing is ridiculous because it is locked into one Kindle, unlike books that can be placed on 6 Kindles. I want to carry a small Kindle on the way but prefer reading on a large Kindle at home. If I subscribe a paper version, my whole family can read different sections at the same time in the morning. If I subscribe a web or iPad version, my whole family can read any section the same time on everyone's iPad. With the Kindle version, only one person can read the journal.

Of course it is almost impossible unless you are a speed reader or have too much time on your hands, but I feel it is very enlightening to at least try.  After those 14 days can you name me a half a dozen news sources that have the breadth and depth of coverage as the Times?  How about 3?  Any?In my opinion the NY Times is one of the world's great news sources.  The breadth and depth of reporting is simply amazing.  Sure, some weeklies or monthlies have a feature article or two that are as deep as articles in Times, but the Times does it day after day.Unfortunately all of this news does not come cheap.  In fact, for new subscriptions and in a few months for all subscriptions, it costs about $20 a month.  With so many cheap or free news sources out there, including some from the NY Times itself, why pay so much?I like reading the Times on my Kindle, particularly my new DX (most pictures blow up very nicely on DX).  I can take it anywhere without worrying about an Internet connection, just like the paper version.  Unlike the paper version I also have it delivered to me no matter where I am.  There are no worries about the environmental damage from making, delivering and disposing of a huge hunk of paper and ink.  Still, is it really worth an average of just over 65 cents an issue?What do you get for that 66 cents anyway?  You can save back issues for reference and pick up missed editions.  I don't have a word count, but I would guess a single copy of the Times is about the size of many best sellers - that is, a book worth of high quality news daily.  There is definitely more information every day than any of the weekly, bi-weekly or even monthly magazines I have read.  Without advertising.I think one thing people miss when they compare the price of Kindle periodicals to the price of the paper version is advertising - a huge amount of their revenue comes from advertising.  Even the on-line version of the Times is packed with advertising.The Kindle version has no advertising, so no income beyond the price of the ""paper"" itself.  That's a major hit on revenue even when you take into consideration the savings in printing and distribution.As a slight aside - I was just looking at the NY Times web site and see they offer an electronic version for $2.62 a week, pretty much the same price as the Kindle version (2.62 /7 = .66 while 239.88/365 = .657).  The paper version costs more (they were advertising the weekender edition for $3.80 a week).  It seems that most Kindle periodicals are now almost the same price as the paper versions, though the paper edition is rarely as expensive as the Times (a single Sunday paper is about $10!).So, is it worth it?  I personally feel that $0.66, which is far less than the price of a cup of coffee, less than one subway trip, less than an impulse buy of the skimpy local paper, etc., is not too much to pay for what I consider the greatest news source on earth.",587,AK7C1AJ9VLT32,Price vs Value,3,4.0,573,83.91,27.65,69.64,48.43,26.05,13.79,87.61,52.18,9.77,5.06,3.14,0.00,1.22,0.00,0.70,4.71,10.47,14.83,6.81,7.50,6.28,1.57,10.82,7.50,4.89,1.40,4.54,4.71,3.32,2.27,1.05,0.35,0.00,0.35,2.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.87,1.57,1.40,0.35,3.32,1.40,4.89,1.05,0.52,0.00,0.52,0.52,0.17,0.00,0.17,0.17,2.97,0.00,0.52,1.75,1.05,0.00,0.52,9.77,0.00,14.83,0.87,6.46,7.68,4.89,0.70,0.00,4.54,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.17,15.36,4.19,4.01,0.17,0.00,1.22,0.17,1.05,1.05,0.52,1.40,1.57

Obviously, it would be nice to have quick access to news of the day as well as detailed articles, as you can get from a computer's internet access. I have tried the New York Times for this service. However, I canceled my subscription after two months. It is incredibly expensive ($13.99 a month) especially for something you can get free online. In addition, you can't scan sections easily, such as you would do with a real paper (view front page section stories).Most importantly, I just can't stand the liberal bias. I expect it on the editorial pages but when it permeates every political article, it is nauseating. It reminds me of a moveon.org mouthpiece. Every political article must be read with your own filter of the motivation of the NYT. I just can't support paying for such bias. And they wonder why they are going bankrupt...Regarding options, I do subscribe to the WSJ which does have a way to scan the important non-business stories of the day, just like their front page right hand column. However, it is just once a day with no update on breaking news. The Kindle blogs on news are all lacking as well, though the Reuters and AP options are the best I have found (though they are left leaning as well).Nevertheless, there is still a void in Kindle news coverage compared to what is available online. How about adding a way to easily read online news from other news outlets such as Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, Drudge, etc?

However, I realize that reading the Times is an investment on human capital, and to me, that is invaluable.  At first, I was ambivalent about the Times on the Kindle because of the 3-star rating it got (I don't like to buy anything below 4-stars, as I believe Amazon reviewers tend to be representative of the population), but the more I read the reviews, they became more polarized and extreme.  So I thought: ""Why not try it for myself? There's a 14-day free trial, at which you can cancel anytime, and the subscription is 20$ per month, which is a far better alternative from the roughly 70$ paper subscription.I get the NY Times downloaded onto my computer, and what do I see? In the Table of Contents (Where all the sections are listed), I see all the sections lined up on the left column, and next to each listing is the number of articles that they provide you, in parenthesis.  As you scroll down the list, there will be the Titles for each of the articles on the right-hand column.  I cannot tell you how convenient this feels.Many people will gripe and moan because the kindle subscription does not offer all the articles.  They probably like to peruse the whole paper, and I admire their diligence and willingness to read as much as possible.  However, some sacrifices have to be made (problems mainly due to licensing).  However, the Times will offer you the majority of what you would normally read (Maybe 90 percent? Sans graphs and charts).  Another added bonus is, you don't have you get your hands dirty anymore and make those wide movements especially on a crowded 7 train in the morning when traffic is heavy.  Simply put, on one single page, you get to see everything you want to see, and then you make a simple-click and get to that spot without the hassle a normal paper would give you.I am 17 years old and I know that many others in my generation will defer the Times for the Post or the Daily News, because it is cheaper and more convenient.  However, with the purchase of my recent kindle, and the NY Times, I am reading A LOT more now (30mins on the paper -> 1 hour kindle).  It is just that much more of a pleasure to read now.  So parents, please invest not only in an Amazon Kindle (or another e-ink reader), but also the NY Times.

In today's world we grab our breakfast on the go.Our children grab their schoolbooks on their way out the door saying "" I'll grab something later."" The time has come that it should no longer be acceptable to bury our heads in the sand and say "" I don't read the news, it's too depressing.  I don't read the news because I don't have time.""We owe it to our children to know what's going on in the world, and when our children see that we find it unacceptable not to know they will become curious themselves.  With the invention of devices like the Kindle we're no longer burdened with the unfolding and spreading out of a bulky newspaper.  We're no longer shackled to a computer desk, or a heavy laptop to find out what's going on.  The visually impaired, or the physically disabled no longer need to be frustrated because smaller handheld devices slip out of our hands, or are just unable to be read by us because of their small print.A new day has come.  Large news organizations with 24 hour a day coverage should no longer be the only place we have time to figure out what's going on.  Those organizations give us a taste, but it is up to the individual to go to the newspapers for the full story.I read this wonderful paper that I am reviewing, and I can testify to its value.  In a debate with a very close friend just a few days ago we were discussing a topic.  I spoke with passion about an article I read in the New York Times.  My friends argument started out with "" Well this journalist on TV said.""I stopped him at that point.  I pointed out I was not discussing the subject with a journalist from TV.  I wanted my friends opinion.  My friend smiled and said "" Touche"".  Then he gave me his opinion, but when I countered with a more detailed argument he was lost.  The TV journalist only gave a basic overview of the issue where on the other hand the newspaper gave specific details.Newspapers on the Kindle make reading the daily paper painless.  There is no ink to get on your hands, it is incredibly compact so it can be read anywhere.  Perhaps a school bus or a crowded coffee shop.With the five way joystick one push to the right takes you to the next article making it incredibly easy to skip over every article you find boring, annoying, or just not grabbing your imagination at that very moment.Bookmark an article you don't have time to read and go right back to it when you have more time.  At the end of the night instead of throwing away the paper, or letting them stack up simply delete it, turn your wireless on before turning off the Kindle, and when you wake up in the morning turn your Kindle on and enjoy the paper all over again.$13.99 a month which means even in the shortest month of the year it's only 50 a day for your newspaper.  They hooked me with the two week free trial.

I hear the conservatives gasping that I would read the NY Times and the liberals saying I'm too evil or too stupid to understand the NY Time's point of view.  To both: lighten up, this is a review, not a Manifesto.Good Things:  (1) NY Times on the Kindle is very well formatted.  I see others have commented that you can get the same info for a lot cheaper by going to the Times' website.  I will gladly pay for the convenience and the quality of the formatting. (2) Great to be able to read the paper when I want; also if I miss a day I can go back to an earlier issue or an article I clipped to get the info I want.  (3) I've not had any issue with delivery.  If I leave my Kindle Wireless on I've found I can get the latest paper by 5:30AM without fail.  If I don't want to leave wireless on to save my battery it only takes less than 1 minute to download any issue. (4) The free trial period sold me.  I was unsure at first but after noticing the good things above I decided to continue my subscription.  I don't know how easy it would have been to cancel but I trust it would be easy with Amazon.  (5) I really enjoy the book reviews but usually check out other websites to make sure the reviewers weren't too biased over the subject matter. (6) It is amazing to read the NY Times and then without fail see the same subject covered the next day on TV--the Time's does seem to establish what is ""the news"" and the others seem to follow like sheep.Bad Things: (1) OK, it is the NY Times-- I won't be able to read much about my Phillies & Eagles until it is Playoff time (take that Mets fans!)but I can at least see the major happenings.  (2) OK, it is the NY Times--I usually just skip over the NY happenings articles & real estate sale sections since it doesn't mean much to me in Indiana.  (3) OK, it is the NY Times-- I have to put up with the politics of the Newspaper on the editorial pages (expected) but why does this bias show up in Science articles & Obituaries?

I am now very pleased with the NYTimes/Kindle service.r-----$20.00 a month seems like a reasonable price to me, as I had been a Sunday-only subscriber for years and the cost of that ran (even while haggling a steep discount every few months)almost $20.00 per month.Positives for the Kindle Edition -Easy - Downloads are a cinch.Portability - Reading The Times on my kindle makes for an easier commute on a crowded Train.I like how the ""paper"" is sectioned, with headlines.Archives - last 7 days archived. Love that.I really like that the ""paper"" is delivered without a driver, or newsprint or ink.Negatives -Can't seem to find ""The Haggler"" which is a Sunday feature I enjoy.I am constantly nagged by the question of what story is not included in the Kindle edition.The un-resolved issue of NYTIMES.com access for Kindle users needs to be cleared up.If you don't download that day's edition, you cannot download it later. (I keep my wi-fi mostly off, to save battery life)Fewer photos and poor resolution of the photos that are delivered.No Wedding pages (I'll live, but do enjoy looking at these announcements)No ads (NY theater, cabaret, etc)All in all, I am pleased with, but not ecstatic about, The NY Times Kindle edition.Randy",241,A2ST35S7FOJGZO,NYTimes on Kindle - It got there,7,4.0,256,78.67,15.49,72.62,93.28,36.57,19.92,80.08,49.61,10.55,6.64,5.86,0.00,0.78,0.00,0.00,3.91,9.38,12.11,7.81,4.69,4.30,3.52,12.89,3.91,3.12,1.17,1.56,2.73,6.64,5.47,1.17,0.00,0.39,0.00,3.12,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.72,3.12,1.17,0.78,3.52,1.56,4.69,1.95,1.95,0.00,0.00,1.17,0.00,0.78,0.00,0.00,3.91,0.78,0.78,1.56,0.78,0.00,1.95,11.72,0.39,11.72,1.56,3.52,6.64,3.91,0.39,0.00,1.56,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,25.39,7.42,4.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.47,2.34,1.56,3.12,1.17

When the ""big"" Kindle was introduced about 1 1/2 years ago, Jeff Bezos had a news conference with the publisher of the NY Times to announce, among other things, that the Times price was going to be dropped to $10 and that the Times was considering subsidizing the purchase of Kindles in areas that couldn't get the paper version of the Times.  Needless to say, neither thing happened!UPDATE:  Just got an email from Amazon announcing a ""Holiday Price Decrease""  (????) for the NYT.  As follows:We're writing to let you know that The New York Times is lowering the monthly price on your Kindle subscription from $19.99/month to $14.99/month during the holiday season to thank you for being a subscriber.This new price will be in effect for customers who are billed between November 1, 2010 and March 1, 2011.  After March 1, 2011, you will be billed at the monthly rate then in effect. We will e-mail you prior to March 1st to remind you of this change.So....to appease all the customers they p*&W;$%ed off they will lower the price back down again for a few months.  OK, fine.

It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting.

However, if I subscribe to the same publication with a U.S. address, the price drops to $19.99, but if I wanted it delivered via Whispernet internationally in over 100 countries (3G & WiFi), I would have to pay $4.99 per week. Do the math, and it makes sense to subscribe with a Japan address. However, if you subscribe to multiple newspapers (which I do), it starts to make sense to subscribe with a U.S. address, and pay the $4.99 weekly fee which covers multiple publications. All this came to light when I couldn't get Reader's Digest with a Japan address (""not available in your area"") and I used my U.S. address, which prompted a message on my Kindle about the international unlimited Whispernet service for periodicals at $4.99 per week. On the other hand, why can't Amazon deliver the NYT via WiFi and not charge the $4.99 which is probably prompted by fees charged by overseas 3G network carriers? Also, the system is set up to try to download on 3G networks first, and WiFi if a 3G connection can't be established, and turning off Whispernet isn't going to help since that would stop WiFi delivery too! I suppose getting a non-3G Kindle (WiFi only) might do the trick, but I'm not springing for another Kindle at this time. Or maybe the NYT should take the example from Newsday (that great Long Island newspaper which I also subscribe to), which has only one price - $14.99 for US or international delivery. The spread on the LA Times is even worse than the NYT - $9.99 domestic delivery, versus $19.99 international.

They altered it last week and it is, far and away, the best lay out of all the papers.  They list the who wrote the story for every section, not just the op-ed as before.  They give more summary of the story.  And, best of all, after reading an article, the next article is right there waiting so you can see if you want to read it instead of having to hit an additional button.  It might not sound like much, but it safes a lot of time.  With the other newspapers--Post, Journal, etc.--it is difficult to find certain articles even when you know where it should be in the paper.  For example, the Post has its daily book review in the Style section.  However, it is often hard to even find the book review.  Or, if you want to read, say, Tony Kornheiser's column before he left the Post, you have to go through all of the headlines before finding it.So, I want to applaud the Times for the changes and urge the other papers, and magazines (who have the same problems), to the layout of the Times and make the changes.

I think the list should also include the author's name.I have to go through a lot of pages to find an article I really feel is important.

They only store 8 days of past history for these subscriptions and everything prior to that time is LOST.This is a SERIOUS deficiency in Amazon's support. I understand the need to protect the publishers copyright, however, Amazon could provide a means for users to upload their subscription library back to an Amazon utility, then have Amazon decrypt and re-encrypt their library keyed to their new hardware. Such would be the logical, and responsible, policy. As it stands I am going to have to spend the time to replace my defective display screen, from the replacement unit sent, and send back the replacement device with my original and defective screen. However, if my loss of pixels (the reason for my warranty replacement) turns out to be caused by a defect in a circuit board on the unit, rather than the display itself, I would be hosed...

The Sunday edition alone costs 52 weeks times $4 = $208 -- by comparison the Kindle version costs me $13.99 times 12 = $167 for all 365 issues.Furthermore, my Kindle edition of the New York Times is always ready and waiting for me no matter how early I wake up in the morning.  This is always nice, but particularly so on holidays when the the New York Times often sells out at the newsstands early.I find myself reading a lot more of the New York Times using my Kindle than I used to read in the pre-Kindle era.  I particularly find myself reading more of the Arts section.  Another good thing about the Kindle edition is that I find myself reading an article from start to finish, whereas there was always a great tendency to skim articles in the pre-Kindle days.The Kindle New York Times does a good job of including pictures.  They are a little fuzzy but good enough to give the general idea.It's true there are no classified ads, but it's rare I need them, so on those occasions I don't mind buying the paper edition.I also particularly like the ability on the Kindle to quickly look up the meaning of a word in the New York Times I don't understand.I can't think of any better way to quickly and methodically gain an in depth understanding of the world around us, than to subscribe  to the Kindle edition of the New York Times.

I expected this would be fixed in version 2, and I'm delighted to say it was.  Therefore, although I've subscribed to daily delivery of the NYT for more than 40 years, I canceled my paper subscription and subscribed on my Kindle. I have been paying $13.40 per week or $696.80 a year.  With the Kindle, I am now paying $167.88 a year.

( I've generally read the FP articles I was interested in and then turned through the rest of the first section, picking up the articles as I went through the section).

Furthermore, if you like to read the paper in bed while your spouse is sleeping, there is no noise from page turning.Cons:*I find the ""black flash"" when you turn a page somewhat annoying. I've gotten in the habit of looking away for a second when I hit the next page button to avoid this. Ideally the new page should appear without any flash* It's slightly heavier than I would prefer but the size is perfect.* The web access feature is experimental and did not work when I tried a simple search using google.* You can't email an article directly from the kindle.

The Kindle edition only costs $14 a month. So, if the Kindle edition of the NYT can replace my print subscription, the Kindle pays for itself in just over a year and a half and I get the Sunday NYT 'for free'. Beyond that, the Kindle edition doesn't involve killing trees or using noxious chemicals to turn them into paper, and beaming my paper to me every morning takes a lot less fossil fuel than trucking trees to a mill, trucking paper to a press, then delivering the printed paper to my driveway. Plus, I never have to go out in the cold or the rain to find my paper in the bushes or under my car; I should never have to deal with a missed paper, which happens once or twice a month with my delivery service; I never have to suspend delivery when I go on a trip; and my newspaper will actually go with me.So, I have a lot of incentive to like the NYT on the Kindle.After three days, I'm still not sure if I do.On the plus side, my biggest worry before my Kindle arrived turns out to be a non-starter. I wondered how I'd take to reading the news on a screen only a few paragraphs big. As promised, this is not an issue. After a very short time, you don't really notice the paging any more than you notice turning the page of a book, or moving your eyes to the next column. I've read a whole novel without any annoyance, and actually find the comfortably sized Kindle less of a hassle than a broadsheet newspaper. (My SO is looking forward to no more piles of old newspapers on the kitchen table, even if that means our 13 yo won't be reading the paper any more.)Also, I find I really don't miss the experience of flipping through the paper, looking for those interesting stories that didn't make the front page. You can browse section by section, and paging through a section a story at a time is really not bad.You can store a lot of days worth of news in a stock Kindle, and can search them all quickly; you can store even more if you add a cheap SD card. In the unlikely event that the Times uses a word you don't know, you can quickly look it up with the Kindle's great search feature.On the minus side, comparing my print edition to the Kindle edition, I can see that the print edition includes stories that the Kindle edition does not. I'm really not sure quite what to make of this: so far, at least, I'm actually reading more of the paper than I used to, because I can carry my Kindle to work and read articles in dead time. It's hard to know how to balance not even seeing some stories vs reading a lot more of them. (I do know that I really miss the Market Gauges pages even if, realistically, I only look at them a few times a month.)A less ambiguous minus is the pictures, which (to use a technical term) really suck. They're hard to make out, and there's a max of one per story, no matter how many there are in the print version. Even worse, many of the pictures and - so far as I can see - ALL the charts and graphs are omitted. This hurts business coverage; I haven't seen a Science Section yet, but I imagine this will be really painful.So. Convenience, greenness, and economics vs the loss of maybe 15% of the content. This is a hard call, for me, and I sure wish the NYT would make it easier by including the missing content.",638,A3QM8GPBZ6OBG8,"Very good, but could be better",6,4.0,645,81.28,15.30,79.97,23.35,32.25,14.88,87.13,54.88,11.63,8.53,6.36,0.16,1.40,0.00,0.62,3.10,11.94,14.11,6.98,6.20,6.36,2.95,13.80,5.58,3.57,1.09,1.55,4.81,3.57,1.71,1.86,0.16,0.31,0.93,3.41,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.18,1.71,1.86,1.24,3.57,1.55,5.74,3.41,2.17,0.00,1.09,0.47,0.16,0.16,0.00,0.16,2.95,0.16,0.47,0.93,1.09,0.47,0.93,11.94,0.78,13.49,2.64,6.05,5.43,4.50,0.31,0.31,1.71,0.00,0.31,0.31,0.16,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.81,4.34,5.74,0.16,0.78,0.00,0.00,0.62,0.00,2.79,0.93,0.47

The purpose of the gift card was because I couldn't figure out how to gift her a one-year subscription outright. So I gifted her the amount of the subscription.Them:Any gift card balance available on your account will be applied to purchases from the Kindle Store, except for content with recurring subscription charges.Me:So, how do we apply this gift card balance to this gift, then?Them:May I place you on hold for 1 to 2 minutes while I check this for you?Me:yes pleaseThem:Thanks for waiting, R....Are you referring to the subscription as gift or the Gift card balance as gift, Jason?Me:The gift was intended to be a 1-year subscription to the NY Times, which I would renew next christmas if she wants it, or else not. However....I couldn't figure out how to gift her this from my own amazon account, where i saw, then (I think) that the yearly subscription rate was $240. This was in December. So....instead, I gifted her a $240 amazon gift card, electronically, delivered to her e-mail address.Then, we tried to redeem the gift card for the NY times subscription, but it looked like we had to do the 1st 14 days free bit, so we couldn't provide the gift card as form of payment then. I told her to let me know once the 14 days was up and we'd figure out then how to apply the gift card to the intended gift--the NY Times subscription.So, she has let me know that it is time to do so, however, I see that it is billing her amazon visa instead. Meanwhile, other purchases she has made (3 shirts) which she intended to use the amazon visa for, instead drew down the balance of the gift card.Them:I'm sorry, Jason. At this time only Kindle books can be given as gifts. The Kindle gifting feature does not support periodicals, active content, free books, or Kindle books on preorder.Gift card balance cannot be applied on the subscriptions.Me:That being the case, I would like my $240 dollars back, please, and I'll buy her an e-subscription to NY times that she can read on her ipad.Can you help me with this?Them:I'm sorry, Jason. Since the purchase was made using the available Gift card balance in your Amazon.com account, our system won't allow us to refund the Gift card balance.Me:I don't understand....what purchase?Them:Three purchases was made from this Amazon.com account and the amount was deducted from the Gift card balance. Hence our systems won't allow us to refund the gift card balance.Me:What can you do for me then?Can we apply the gift card balance to her amazon.com visa account?Them:Please be on hold. Let me check what possible I can do for you.Me:HoldingThem: Thanks for waiting.Me:OKThem: I'm sorry, Jason. Since the Gift card balance was already used, it is not possible to issue refund or transfer the gift card to another account.Me:What will be possible, then?Them: Using the gift card balance in the same account is the only option. If you'd prefer, I can either turn off the auto renew for subscription or cancelling it completely.Me:Dev, do you care about the satisfaction of Amazon customers?Them:I can understand your concern, Jason. However, our systems won't allow us to change the Amazon policies. This is the reason I'm unable to do anything. I tried to check and do the possible for you. But our systems won't allow us to do that. I'm really sorry for any inconvenience.Me:My question was whether you are interested in the satisfaction of your customers. Are you?Them:Yes, ofcourse.But in this case, I'm unable to do anything from my end, Jason.Me:Ok, I am having an extremely unsatisfying experience, so I know that must be as upsetting to you, as it is to me. Correct?If you were me, would you be satisfied with this outcome?You can just imagine how helpless my elderly, mostly homebound mother must feel.You mention that the ""systems"" won't let you create a solution that will be satisfactory. Correct?Them:Our systems work as per our Amazon policy and won't make us any change to the Amazon.com Policy. This is the reason I'm unable to do anything from my end. I can understand your concern and even I would have felt the same. However, out system won't allow us to make any changes to make it work breaking the Amazon policy.I'll forward your concern to our Kindle development team and we'll consider your feedback as we plan further improvements. We're regularly working on improvements to your Kindle experience. Your valuable feedback will help us to improve the selection and service we provide.Me:Systems may be programmed to enforce policies, but policies are created by people. Are there people there who are authorized to make exceptions to, or override policies, when those policies don't make sense? Or, are their policies for, or decision makers who are authorized to, make things right for unsatisfied customers?If so, I would very much appreciate, ..., if you could put me in touch with one of those people. As it is, you are the only person I ""know"" at Amazon.Besides...., of course, who was good enough to put me in touch with you when he realizedhe was not in a position to help me.Them:If you'd prefer, I can connect you for a call and let they transfer the call to the appropriate department and let they check what possible they can do. But I'm unable to do anything from my end, Jason.Could you provide me your phone number so that I can connect you for a call now?Me:Certainly..... Will you be able to provide them this transcript, or must I start from the beginning.Them:You can ask them to check the chat conversation. All our chat conversation are stored in our systems.I'll connect you for a call now. Please be on hold.Me:Thank you.Them:You're welcome, Jason.Connecting your call.Your call is now connected.

Kindle should either tell its subscribers specifically what content is not included, or, preferably, Kindle should fix the problem.I have been complaining about this issue for awhile, and until now your representatives have told me that the Times is responsible for content, not Kindle.

When I heard I could have the Times delivered to my Kindle I was thrilled since reading on the Kindle is far nicer than reading on a laptop. Then I actually tried the Kindle version and was VERY disappointed.The problem is the content - or to be more accurate the LACK of content. Simply put, your subscription fee on Kindle gives you only a very tiny slice of the NY Times. For example, the December 25ht, 2009 edition contains a paltry 6 articles for the Front Page section. Furthermore, several sections are completely missing. In a rather ironic twist, two of the missing sections are the Technology and Books sections - go figure! Also missing are Science, Health, Education, Automobiles, and several other sections. The **free** NY Times site contains over 2 dozen sections while the **paid** Kindle version contains only 9 sections. Seems odd that a paid subscription should result in less content. I get that there are costs associated with delivering digital content but I find it hard to believe that the costs are that much higher than delivering the NY Times content. Some of this is no doubt due to the lack of advertisements on the Kindle version but given a choice between more content with ads or less content without ads I'll put up with the ads anytime.While the promise of a Kindle edition is great the actual execution comes up very short. For now I'll stick to the free on-line edition.

As a charter member of the Tightwad's Club I was also griping about the rather pricey $13.99 monthly subscription rate. Regardless, I figured I might as well use the free two-week trial that's offered to all Kindle owners.Two weeks and two business trips later, I'm here to tell you that this subscription is worth every penny of the $13.99/month. How many times have you struggled to read a newspaper on a flight? Whether it's folding it up, knocking things over or just getting all that nasty ink on your hands, I've never found it convenient to read a paper on an airplane. The Kindle newspaper experience is, of course, a breeze by comparison.I especially loved it that no matter where I was in the country I knew when I woke up the latest edition was waiting for me. Then there's the quality of the content. Sorry, Indianapolis Star editorial team, but I can't believe the quality OpEd material I've been missing out on. Thomas Friedman alone is probably worth the $13.99 monthly fee. In fact, I'm now struggling with whether I should bother maintaining a subscription to the Indianapolis Star. The only thing that's standing between me and cancellation is my wife; she enjoys reading it, particularly since she doesn't get regular access to the Times on my Kindle.Are there drawbacks? Sure. The ""Back"" button doesn't always take me where I think it should. I've also had a couple more Kindle lockups while reading the Times. And although it's kind of nice to read a paper with no ads, it feels odd. A work colleague was showing me his new 3G iPhone the other day and mentioned that The New York Times is completely free on it. As I tried it out I noticed subtle ads at the bottom of each screen. I'm not sure if that's how Apple is funding free access to the Times but Amazon should explore the same option, even if it's only to lower the price further and bring in a much larger audience.The other thing that still feels strange is how this service straddles the fence between static and dynamic content. All you're getting is an image of each day's newspaper, which is fine, but since I have a live connection why not offer periodic updates throughout the day? The Times website offers breaking news from time to time, so why not push that out to Kindle subscribers as well?Overall though I'm now a huge fan of The New York Times and am thoroughly enjoying the experience of reading it on my Kindle.Joe WikertKindleville Blog ([...]",456,A16ZJF0NNTOEPR,"Boy, Was I Wrong...",4,2.6666666666666665,462,58.38,23.75,78.62,37.25,23.10,17.97,85.28,53.68,14.29,8.01,6.49,0.00,0.87,0.65,0.00,6.28,9.74,11.90,8.87,7.36,6.71,1.95,15.15,5.84,2.81,2.60,1.30,2.38,4.55,2.60,1.95,0.43,0.43,0.87,4.11,0.22,0.22,0.65,0.22,12.34,1.95,1.95,1.73,1.73,2.60,3.68,1.73,0.65,0.00,0.65,0.65,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,5.19,1.30,0.65,2.16,1.30,0.00,2.81,9.74,0.65,16.02,1.52,6.06,8.66,3.03,0.87,0.00,2.38,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,16.02,5.19,3.25,0.00,0.22,0.87,0.00,0.22,0.43,4.33,0.22,1.30

I have been paying $26 (!!) a month for having (ONLY) Sunday edition delivered to my house in Washington DC......  Or now even more starting next week--  $7.50 per Sunday issue according to the notification I just received from the delivery service, to be exact.  Today for a comparison experiment, I downloaded the Sunday edition to my Kindle for a whopping 75 cents.  That is at least 10 times less than paper version.  I compared article for article, section for section to see the differences.  I found a very very small number of articles missing from the kindle version, and none of them were tragic if I didn't have them.  Obviously no ads, which is a bonus.  I was delighted that all book review articles were there on kindle and all of the magazine section, both very important for me to even consider switching.  Even better, the NY ""local"" Metro and Real Estate sections were available on the Kindle, which the ""national"" version of the Sunday paper does not even have.  These are half the point of why I originally had the Sunday delivered to DC, but gave up trying to beg the NY Times to see reason to deliver the ""local"" version to somewhere outside of NYC.  Only missing piece on Kindle that I wish it had was the ""Week in Review"" themed blurbs on the second page of the Week in Review and the snippets from comedian's late shows, also on that Page 2.  I can live with this loss for saving $6.75+ per week!  Plus I bet the NYT will come around to include them eventually.  After a 10 minute learning curve, I got good at navigating around to whatever section I wanted and started scanning articles as if it was a print edition.  I was still missing the idea of the newspaper edition for another 30 minutes or so, but then got absorbed in an article and realized I was fine without it by then. Plus it is way easier to read on kindle than juggling print version wherever I was in the mood to read it in the house, on porch, at table today.  I didn't notice any more typos than the print edition, which has always been hopelessly full of them, so that is non-issue.  I just couldn't find the problems that some reviewers had with the kindle version, despite trying very hard not to like the kindle version.  So comparing the money saved, to the 2-3 articles missing out of probably 100 that were there in-full, this is a no-brainer.

Surprisingly nothing of consequence has changed. The Avantgo application that I refer to is no longer around. However I now just use the Times mobile site which has equivalent features; thanks to the Times for providing that service! I can view the Times' mobile site on my smartphone (which replaced my PDA) either thru wifi or over-the-air.Like Avantgo the mobile site provides excellent color images. All-in-all the Times mobile site is perhaps even better than Avantgo used to be, the only downside is that it is 'streamed' in the sense that you must be on-line either with wifi or your phones data plan; you can't 'take it with you', like the Kindle edition. If you have an iPhone you will be even better off, since there is an App for that; using the App you don't need to be online as the content will be updated each time you open the App and cached on the iPhone.One other informational note: many newspapers such as the Washington Post, London Times etc. have 'moble' sites now to capture the smartphone market. These are really excellent tools, since they are in large part advert-free, including just text and images. If you haven't tried them they are in many ways superior to the smartphone 'browser' experience being much faster and simpler to navigate.Back to the NY Times Kindle editions: I have become something of a fan of single Sunday editions since the price is such a bargain, and I can read sections during the following week.The Times web site has been vastly improved in many ways since my original review, so it is an even more compelling alternative setting aside the price (free). I'm pleased that the Times is evolving, we all have to root for their survival and success; I still maintain that their marketing dept should join the 21st. century along with their editorial staff.--------- Original Review from 2007 follows ---------------To put this review in perspective I've been reading the NY Times every day for several years on my PDA, as delivered electronically by [...]. That edition has been my 'gold standard' for e-reading because I can download it in just a few minutes as my coffee brews along with the Washington Post and London Times, and then read it as I have my coffee, or take it with me to read on a commute. (When I'm travelling I can get my daily dose of newspapers from avantgo as long as there is wifi nearby.)NY Times recently made significant improvements to their avantgo edition, so it includes all the major sections of the paper. The articles are all text, no ads, and interestingly on the PDA the pictures are quite good and in color(!). But...although the main articles are included, many are not because of the format, space, whatever. Bottom line, there are still enough articles that I run out of time before I run out of articles. The only drawback (for me) is that the PDA form factor, while great for travel, is a little space-challenged. Nevertheless, as I mentioned, it's my 'gold standard' for electronic editions since I don't want to carry my laptop everywhere. And the avantgo service is free.So I was pretty excited to compare the Kindle subscription edition with what I've been using. To cut to the chase I'm happy to report that, for me, the Kindle edition is far superior. There are many more articles, improved navigation and of course the form factor! I was overwhelmed with the Sunday edition which has the magazine and book reviews in addition to the regular news. All-in-all a great offering.Now about the price of the subscription. I thought it was too high until I went and looked at the alternative offerings. Turns out it's half the price of the print edition, and just about the same price as the electronic edition. (Of course the web edition and avantgo are free in comparison.) So I can see where NY Times slotted this subscription, I have to say it fits in pretty well with the alternatives.But...I'm afraid it won't succeed at this price. And that concerns me because I really want these Kindle subscriptions to be wild successes and stoke the Kindle experience itself. (Which is why I'm taking the time and trouble to write this review.)The price point needs to be $9.95, or even $5.95 to get significant traction. People who will subscribe are not choosing between print and electronic, they are choosing between Kindle and free (web or PDA) electronic alternatives.My claim here is that any income the NY Times gets from a Kindle subscription is incremental, and they are not going to capture these subscribers thru one of their other channels. In my own case I'm willing to go from a zero cost subscription to a paid subscription, but not at the current price.I'm disappointed the Times doesn't seem to see the potential of e-delivery as offered by Kindle, at least as far as pricing their product to make it a wild success...",854,AAPD8AW5GBP9F,"Very good electronic version, pricing not quite there yet.",9,4.0,881,71.38,28.89,62.61,82.62,27.53,18.73,83.65,53.46,12.83,7.72,5.33,0.11,1.02,0.00,1.25,5.11,8.29,14.42,9.53,4.88,6.58,1.48,14.07,5.90,3.63,1.14,1.25,2.84,4.43,3.75,0.57,0.23,0.00,0.23,3.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.53,1.02,2.50,0.91,1.70,1.25,3.41,1.59,1.02,0.23,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.23,4.20,0.23,1.82,0.79,1.82,0.23,1.70,11.69,0.91,14.07,1.93,6.13,6.02,5.22,0.68,0.00,2.27,0.00,0.00,0.68,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.11,0.00,20.89,6.02,3.97,0.34,0.45,0.00,0.34,3.97,0.00,3.52,1.82,0.45

Despite some stumbles over the years (Jayson Blair) the Times remains a 5 star newspaper.So in the hopes of helping others decide if the New York Times is a good idea on the Kindle, here's the good and the bad.The Good:* Wireless delivery each morning, early enough that by the time you wake up, the paper's waiting for you.* User-friendly formatting makes it easy to decide how you want to read the paper. You get the article title and the first few lines to decide what to read. You can jump to a section, the front page, or do what I did, just scroll through all articles and read as you go along. The Kindle's back button makes it easy to jump back to the articles list.* I had no problem with the pictures and the lack of other images. I understand why others do, but I don't find that the images add much to reading the Times in-depth reporting.The bad:* On more than one occasion, my paper was late or didn't deliver until I went and retrieved it. This may seem like a minor issue - it only takes a few minutes to go into the Kindle content manager and send the paper to Kindle from the Amazon site. But if you're paying this much for an electronic version, you ought to get all conveniences.* The price. This was the real deal breaker. I can go to the Times' website, click on ""Today's Paper,"" and get the exact same list of articles for the Kindle for free. I'm always around a computer, so this isn't much of a problem for me. However, if the time comes when I'm not always around a computer, I would revisit a Times subscription - the Kindle makes it very convenient.* No bang for your buck. On top of the expense, you don't get anything but the paper. Amazon should make arrangements with the Times to get every Kindle subscriber a free subscription or access to the online crossword puzzles. Right now the Times charges a fee to access this; Kindle subscribers are paying enough they ought to have access to these online features.If Amazon and the Times lower the price, or throw in some additional benefits for being a subscriber, I'd reconsider my decision to cancel. Or, if I find myself without a computer more frequently, I'd also reconsider.

I make no argument that the Times has very well written pieces, but where are all the sections? I should not have to supplement through news blogs to get the latest on science, health, technology, etc. These sections are thoroughly covered for FREE on the New York Times website. Why should I have to pay $19.99 to get half of what is offered for free? And to be perfectly honest, I am not gripping about the price if I got all the news available. I got it that the crossword puzzles, classifieds, etc would not be available, and that does not really bother me. As other reviewers have broke down the cost: $19.99/ 30 days = .66 cents a day. That is less than the .99 cent price if you bought individual papers daily from Amazon. I am just wondering where is the content, and why am I paying an extra $15 to get the news that the Times should be supplying me with in the first place?Is this stupidity on my part? Probably so, but the Times is the only digital paper I have found thus far to cover political, international, business, and national news so thoroughly in one shot. I also have subscriptions to news blogs that update throughout the day with the most current news, but the collection is not as wide - say 6 international stories for the blog as compared to 14 international stories from the Times.My stupidity will not go on for long.

When the editor of the site doesn't include her own column, there is a problem.  Garrison Keillor's weekly column doesn't show up either, nor does Camille Paglia's occasional piece.  The notorious Life essays rarely show up either.  Last week's essay about some self-absorbed woman who left her husband after decades of marriage never made it to my Kindle, even as it made the rounds on several popular blogs.  I have found out about several other missing essays after reading another blog's comments about the piece.

This often means that the day's feature piece doesn't arrive to Kindle until the next day, even though computer readers have been able to see it since before Salon staffers have started their new work day.

This person must have not moved past the 1st page. Yes, there is no section titled sports, but the sports section is fully included it is just in the horoscope section. Try to move past the 1st page before you review somethingDerek attempts to make an ""educated"" review but also mentions there is no sports section. He then also goes on to compare the yearly price of the NY Times vs Daily news NEWSSTAND price. This would be relevant had we been buying the newsstand version of this paper, but we're not. Again, before reviewing, please read past page 1 and try to be relevant. It's obvious you're a NY Times fan boy.***REVIEW***For the price this can't be beat. It does have some flaws, but it's only 99 cents a month, and for that price it's an easy buy. The flaws that is has are things that can easily be fixed with them checking their format. Some pages are unreadable because of incorrect formatting, BUT its not a lot of pages. If there are 50 articles, i would say MAYBE 3-4 pages are unreadable. Oh well, there are a lot of other articles I can read. The sports section IS there it is just in the horoscope section. Oh well, i just go to the horoscope section to read the sports. The articles are good, it scrolls very well, and the font size is perfect for the kindle. I've tried multiple magazines that are very had to read but this is perfect. The ONLY issue i do have is that the delivery time varies. Sometimes I get the paper at 6am, sometimes at 11am. That is the only issue i have but for the price that is hardly a deal breaker because the paper comes every day regardless.This newspaper is 99 cents a month compared to the $20 a month for the NY Times. If we compare kindle versions and NOT newsstand versions, that's $12 a year for the Daily news vs $240 a year for the NY Times. With the few flaws that this paper has that CAN be fixed, I will gladly save the $200+ per year. This paper because of the low price gets 4 stars.

Being an avid and multiple magazine subscriber, the best benefit of Amazon's  pay per month or issue option, is that  I no longer have magazine clutter.  This option is best utilzed for those magazines you do not currently have a yearly subscription.  I have yearly subscriptions that offer the ""free digital editions"" and honestly, it seems redundant. The advantage being all of my magazines are on my Kindle Fire, ready and available at a moments notice. Also great for those long doctor's office waits, kids' track training, etc.. Convenience is about the only pro to ""paid print/free digital"" in my opinion.  Two examples would be Entertainment Weekly and People Magazine.  The previous ""extra content"" available on the digital editions has become almost non-existent. I received my subscriptions to each magazine several years ago  at an amazingly reduced price through auto-renewal, before digital apps became available.  I would never consider cancelling either subscription due to the price alone.  However,  I now have two exact copies of each magazine.  Some weeks I share my print issues with friends.One magazine I enjoy the print along with digital issue is All You.  I use the print version for the monthly coupons which leaves some of the articles/recipes destroyed after clipping the coupons.  By having the digital copy, problem solved.While I will always prefer an acutal magazine, and book, in my hands,  I thoroughly  enjoy Amazon's digital delivery and the monthly or current issue option.  The monthly option, even on weekly magazines, is less expensive than purchasing the print edition weekly, monthly, or even yearly, without a subscription.Some readers are also confused as to how long an issue remains on your Kindle Fire. While Amazon states older issues will be deleted for your convenience, with the 7 most recent issues being saved, these settings can easily be changed:From the carousel, touch and hold magazine of choice, an option box will appear with settings:  add to favorites, remove from carousel, delete, and keep. Touch ""keep"" to ensure magazine of choice will not be deleted. Afterwards, you will notice the magazine you chose to ""save"" will have a digital ""earmark"" at the top right hand corner of the magazine denoting your ""save"".To view past weekly/monthly digital deliveries, touch and hold until the option box appears, choose ""show all issues"" to view previous issues.I hope these tips are useful and allow you to enjoy your digital deliveries even more.",566,A3NGR76OYOUVEV,Excellent Digital Delivery App For My Favorite Magazine,8,5.0,555,81.89,35.91,48.14,90.85,22.20,25.77,81.62,43.24,9.19,6.85,5.05,0.00,1.62,0.00,0.18,2.34,7.39,11.53,7.57,3.42,5.59,0.90,10.99,6.67,2.88,0.36,1.26,4.14,5.77,4.86,0.90,0.18,0.18,0.18,3.06,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.00,11.17,2.16,0.90,1.62,4.68,1.44,2.34,2.70,1.26,0.00,1.26,1.44,0.36,0.18,0.00,0.90,2.88,0.36,1.08,1.08,1.26,0.18,1.98,8.83,1.26,12.79,1.80,3.60,7.57,1.98,3.78,0.00,2.16,0.00,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.46,5.95,6.67,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.26,3.24,1.08,0.00,0.90

It offered an alternative to the progressive establishment Republican line that had taken over the American right.  Amcon took an even line on the mid-east, stood against immigration, social engineering, took a variety of stances on free trade, from libertarian to protectionist, and in general represented a broad spectrum of the fusion movement that American conservativism always was.Things went well until Pat and Taki left, leaving the undeniably leftist Scott McConnell in charge.  The magazine took on a definite leftward slant since.  Ron Unz, immigration enthusiast then took over and things went from bad to worse.Today, the so-called ""American Conservative"" is supportive of open borders, illegal immigrants, third world immigration in general, multi culturalism , Obama (!), and generally looks on leftist hate mongers and social engineers with a smile.  Most of all, they have an undying hatred for Israel.  I can live with a balanced approach for sure, or even an anti Israel approach, but TAC is over the top and takes a strange leftist like concern for the ""poor brown Palestinians"".There are a large number of openly leftist writers at TAC and an even larger number who are half-in-the-closet.  Why, when the media is dominated by the left would a magazine proclaiming to be conservative employ so many non conservatives?  There are thousands of outlets for them.The biggest problem with TAC is that it is a force that absorbs what remains of the true Right in this country, pretending to be the true voice of conservativism, and then neutralizes them, ensuring they will pose no threat to the leftist establishment.

It seemed like the editors ran out of ideas for articles about money and finance due to the amount of completely unrelated articles. In the last issue before i cancelled, i read one short article total. The rest had no appeal at all to me. It took me less than five minutes start to finish to scan through the magazine and read the single semi-appealing article. I don't expect to enjoy every article in any magazine, but the problem here is the finance articles seemed to dry up, and some of the other articles seemed to be no different than something i could make up in 15 minutes to fill up a page.I hope this changes in the future, but until then, I will be sticking with my normal financial blogs that I read.

Zagg is by far the best, but it is usually around 30 dollars per device. Armor suit and Marware I would not recommend in general.  I would HIGHLY recommend this Buffalo protector for two reasons. Easy install, just pull the tabs from underneath while applying pressure with a credit card and I only had one small bubble. The claim for anti-fingerprint is GOOD! It will not prevent them 100%, but I haven't noticed barely any fingerprints since I put it on. I use to wipe it down twice a day with cloth, now once every two days. So if you want two shields for 7.50 a piece or anti-fingerprint, then this is for you. Whether to have a backup in case you mess up, or have two new kindles(my reason). Both protectors went on both kindles with about the same quality. Check out the i-Blason if you only need/want one, as it can save you 5 bucks.

I have been enjoying the CSM on my Kindle for some time but have lately found it very disappointing.  For the past several days, I received only two or three articles each day, and these were weekdays not the weekend.  Those articles were interesting, but I canceled my subscription. Why pay for news I am not receiving?! My below review pertains to my past experience with the paper, not to my current experience.  I have changed the title of my review to reflect my present feelings and changed my rating from the four stars I originally gave it to the two stars (really one-and-a-half stars!) I would give it today because of its failure to send enough articles to justify the price.  Here is my original review:For those wanting to read The Christian Science Monitor on their easy-on-the-eyes Kindle, this subscription has its pros and cons, but the pros outweigh the cons for me.It is true that the Monitor's own website, which I frequently scan, has a lot of content which does not download as part of the subscription and that the number of articles which does download varies.  Because the CSM does not publish much on the weekend, few articles download on Sunday and Monday.  On the other hand, about 30 articles download Tuesday through Saturday.The daily World and USA sections form the heart of the subscription.  The numerous articles in each, some of which display a photo, provide excellent news analysis because they present more than one point of view about the situation being discussed, a great strength of the CSM, which is known for its balanced reporting.  The Monitor saves its own viewpoints for the weekday Commentary section, which also presents those of contributors representing different areas of expertise.  Indeed, reading the CSM for a while has left me feeling well-informed about world and national issues, not only about what is happening but also about ""why,"" ""how,"" and ""what may come next.""Some Kindle readers, however, might opt, as I have been doing, to combine the CSM with a daily ""latest news"" blog having an updating feed because each morning's CSM download will not update and will include only what is on the Monitor's website before the download occurs.  Thus, each morning's download inevitably brings yesterday's articles.  On the day after it had already landed, I received an article about the landing of the space shuttle Discovery.  It appeared on the same download as an even older one titled ""When Is the Space Shuttle Discovery Set to Land?""Fortunately, most articles, which are written by the Monitor's own staff writers and correspondents positioned around the world, focus on the implications of an event--what may have led to it, what may follow, how it connects to other situations and broader issues.  In this way, even yesterday's news articles often bring new insights.Whenever the Science, Environment, or Innovation section downloads, I always enjoy its articles.  I skim the weekday Business section and particularly look forward to the weekday Books section.  As well as an extremely brief piece by a Monitor reader who names a recommended title, it usually includes a longer, more satisfying review by a contributor who puts me in touch with a work I otherwise might have missed.  (The emphasis has been on non-fiction and biography.)  Appearing, too, in this section each week is a list of the bestselling books of that week according to IndieBound, and on notable dates, such as the Ides of March or St. Patrick's Day, a reviewer recommends several books relevant to the date, a nice feature.Another favorite section, The Culture, usually contains two or more articles and downloads frequently.  As somebody interested in the arts, I especially appreciate the occasional pieces focused on music, dance, art or drama.  I wish there were more because they give insights I do not find elsewhere.  Movie reviews turn up each week, and a poem occasionally appears, though Kindle does not usually format it well.  The Culture sometimes includes a story about a person making a difference or about a person's memorable experience, such as a recent piece about an encounter between two women during a train ride across Turkmenistan.  While the CSM is not a religious publication, this section frequently includes an article about an event, often one in the news, discussed from a Christian Science perspective.  I belong to a different denomination but still like reading it.All in all, I have been enjoying this CSM subscription.  I do supplement it with a ""latest news"" blog having an updating feed (which is also nice to have on the days when the Monitor downloads less content), and with other material related to my own interests.  However, in spite of a few drawbacks, the subscription offers much to those who want the CSM on their kind-to-the-eyes, transportable Kindles.  I particularly value the Monitor's independence from any large corporations, its emphasis on the positive, and its non-sensational, non-celebrity-driven, well-balanced coverage of the news.",856,A2HQ8SXJKWWIR,Well-Balanced News Analysis If One Receives It!,7,2.0,852,82.76,30.69,77.77,71.98,25.82,26.76,82.86,51.41,10.56,4.34,3.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.47,6.22,11.03,12.79,5.75,6.92,6.69,1.17,9.74,5.28,3.29,2.70,1.64,4.34,3.40,2.93,0.47,0.00,0.12,0.35,3.87,0.00,0.12,0.12,0.00,12.32,2.00,2.00,0.47,3.52,1.29,3.87,2.58,1.64,0.12,0.47,0.70,0.47,0.00,0.00,0.23,1.76,0.23,0.47,0.94,0.23,0.12,2.82,6.10,0.94,16.31,2.23,6.46,8.33,3.17,1.64,0.00,0.35,0.35,0.00,0.59,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.47,0.00,17.72,4.34,7.39,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.23,2.00,1.41,1.17,0.70,0.00
B001PKUVWG,Kindle Store,"[33, 33]",3.0,1.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,"I subscribed to the daily print edition of the Christian Science Monitor for several years, until they stopped printing it on 3/30/09. Over its 100-year history, the CSM has been widely regarded as one of the most objective newspapers in English. I don't need a newspaper to tell me what to think, I just want to know what happened, and why. The CSM has their own journalists writing their own stories, without simply reprinting wire service feeds. And the paper often gives backgrounders to major stories, so you can understand why events are unfolding as they are. Because it has a relatively small staff, some stories just don't get covered, so you have to rely on other sources such as radio or your local paper or, failing that, TV.The print edition took at least a week to get to me (in Canada), and cost $300 a year for five issues a week. The Kindle edition is seven days a week, delivered to me first thing in the morning, every morning, for $10 a month. My Kindle pays for itself in a year. How can you beat that?I'd say the Tuesday through Saturday editions have at least a third more content than the print edition did, although the Sunday and Monday editions are very slim, with less than a half-dozen stories.On the Kindle, it's easy to navigate through the paper, or any newspaper for that matter, so you can easily find stories of interest, keep back issues, and even clip articles you want to save. I still buy single copies of the New York Times, the Globe & Mail, and some other papers, to get more news whenever I have more time to read, but the CSM and my other reading generally keeps me busy.But it is disturbing to see many stories on the CSM website that didn't make it into the Kindle edition. Some of those stories are wire service stories, but a lot of them are stories written by CSM staff, correspondents, and guest bloggers. Those stories should be on the Kindle but they're not; I'd like to know why that's the case. So I give the Kindle edition of the CSM 4 stars, instead of 5.",368,AUTD5EE9PTEZQ,An always-excellent newspaper at a reasonable price,7,4.0,375,76.47,47.87,46.89,35.06,28.85,18.13,84.00,52.00,12.00,6.67,3.73,0.00,1.60,0.00,1.33,5.33,9.07,14.13,7.47,5.60,7.20,1.33,13.87,4.80,3.47,1.87,4.27,4.27,1.60,1.07,0.53,0.27,0.00,0.27,7.47,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,11.20,1.33,1.87,1.07,2.93,0.27,4.53,1.07,0.53,0.53,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,3.20,0.00,0.80,1.60,1.07,0.53,1.87,11.20,0.00,12.00,0.27,4.53,7.47,6.13,0.80,0.00,0.80,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.07,4.27,7.73,0.00,0.27,0.27,0.00,0.53,0.00,2.13,0.53,1.33

The point of the review is to let you know whether (as of July 2009) you should be reading The Corner using the subscription service or the Basic Web browser.The two main problems I'd had with reading The Corner on the Kindle via Basic Web are 1) posts in The Corner make heavy use of block quotes, which are merged into one big paragraph in the Kindle display, leaving you to guess where the quotes end (and, sometimes, begin); and 2) although while reading The Corner on the Kindle browser you can follow links (plentiful on The Corner, often presented with a word or two for a teaser), if you use the Back button so as not to lose your place on the page, your Kindle will very soon freeze up, so you need to disconnect the battery or hit the recessed reset button.  It was these problems that convinced me to try out the subscription service.The subscription service improves upon the browser experience by producing nicer headings for each post, but the formatting problems for quotes remain for the subscriber, and the links are now missing entirely (i.e., the often-cryptic teaser remains without any indication that there was a reference to another site in the post), making reading a bit more frustrating and confusing.  And of course it costs money.  So for those who don't get consistent wireless access and/or need to browse The Corner with Whispernet off, the subscription may well be your only option, but for everyone else Basic Web probably remains a better bet.While I can understand why links aren't implemented in a subscription (although since links are such an important part of The Corner, perhaps an indication that a link was present is in order), quote formatting really should work correctly, if the object is to present the content of the blog in a reader-friendly format.",344,A1T8O21WVW9N9E,A rating of the format...,5,3.0,347,91.96,47.69,55.97,11.01,69.40,20.17,82.13,53.89,6.92,3.46,0.86,0.00,2.59,0.00,0.00,3.46,13.83,14.12,7.49,5.48,7.49,1.44,13.83,3.46,1.73,1.44,2.02,2.02,4.32,1.44,2.59,0.29,0.86,0.58,4.03,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,17.00,2.88,2.31,2.59,5.48,1.15,4.90,1.44,0.29,0.29,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.61,0.29,1.44,1.15,1.15,1.15,1.15,9.22,1.15,15.85,0.86,10.09,4.32,2.02,0.29,0.00,0.86,0.00,0.29,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,13.83,2.88,5.19,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.86,0.00,0.86,3.46,0.29

However to me this is a publication you want to keep as a reference in case you are ever going to make that exotic journey you planned and unfortunately this probably is not going to happen if you buy this from Amazon. There are a couple of things going on here.1) There are a limited number (7) of back issues issues that can be kept in the cloud. You can keep more on the Kindle Fire itself, however all the Fires including the new ones do not have expandable storage. Color magazines like these are not tiny files and if you have some music plus books plus back issues of a couple of magazines (like I do) then onboard storage starts to diminish pretty rapidly.2) And this is even more important. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ANY BACK COPIES STORED IN THE CLOUD. YES YOU LOSE WHAT YOU HAVE PAID FOR. Now again you can elect to ""keep"" the back copies on the KF but they eat up onboard storage and if you have several subscriptions you will have problems.It is much better to use the Z i n i o app and buy publications through them.

This Single is very short and to the point. There is a short history on how the movement came about and the events that transpired on October 1st including before the march began, what happen on the bridge, and after the arrests. You hear these coming from several different participants with different demographics. You hear from people who were located near the front, middle, and rear of the march.

Clearly the complaints about late delivery are out of date.I should note that 4 stars is the highest rating I can give any Kindle version of newspapers as long as they fail to include comics, local weather, local TV listings, etc. The Chronicle already seems to include more of its content on the Kindle than any other paper (especially the Sunday edition), but not enough for the elusive fifth star.",184,A3NYEQFIZ2MZON,"If you haven't tried it recently, you haven't really tried it",11,4.0,186,91.73,25.93,92.33,35.14,26.57,24.19,78.49,45.70,9.68,4.84,4.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.54,4.84,8.06,15.59,5.38,4.30,4.84,0.54,9.14,7.53,5.38,1.08,2.69,3.23,3.76,2.15,1.61,0.00,0.00,1.08,2.15,0.00,0.54,0.00,0.00,9.14,1.08,0.00,0.54,2.15,2.15,3.76,0.54,0.54,0.00,0.00,2.15,0.00,1.61,0.00,0.54,5.38,0.54,3.23,2.69,0.54,0.54,5.38,5.91,0.00,20.97,0.54,9.14,11.83,3.23,1.61,0.00,1.08,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.67,4.30,8.06,0.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.61,0.00,0.00,2.15,0.00

The newspaper is usually available by 6 am each day, and this suits my schedule just fine.  The Kindle version has a summary page which shows each section of the paper and the number of articles in each section along with a short summary. I can use this page to read just the articles that are of interest to me. The ability to cut and save articles is also a big plus.  As some reviews have pointed out, there are no ads, obituaries, sports box scores, movie listings, etc.  Some of these omissions detract from the electronic newspaper, and I hope the Chronicle will consider listing, for example, the obituaries in the near future and making other changes.The main difference for me is the fact that it takes me much longer to read the Kindle version of the Chronicle.  I have a tendency to scan through the articles and this isn't possible with the Kindle.  Perhaps this is a good thing.

This book also fills out a little more about what happens between Ash and Meghan to makes things super tense when they are in the Winter Court, in The Iron Daughter.I really enjoyed the story.  I read it on my Kindle and it was a great read.  It is just a novella though and, at 60 some pages long, only takes an hour or two to read.  Still it is a nice interlude to hold you through until you can read The Iron Daughter.  Which by the way is an excellent book too.  I am very impressed with Kagawa's writing, I love how she leaves all the bad, gritty things in fairy with all the good.",266,A22B13EJTZKCTM,"4.5 stars, what happens after Meghan leaves her house but before she gets to the Winter Court...",17,4.166666666666667,259,59.91,78.01,29.45,98.70,18.50,11.97,85.71,54.05,18.15,9.27,4.25,0.00,1.54,1.54,1.93,8.88,8.11,12.36,5.41,5.79,8.11,0.00,12.36,5.41,2.32,2.32,1.16,1.54,8.11,6.95,1.16,0.39,0.00,0.00,12.36,1.16,0.00,2.70,0.77,5.02,0.39,1.16,0.39,1.54,0.77,1.93,0.77,0.77,0.00,0.00,1.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.49,1.16,1.54,1.54,3.86,0.77,3.09,7.72,0.77,13.13,1.93,5.79,5.41,4.25,1.54,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,14.29,6.56,3.47,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.39,0.39,0.00,0.77,1.54,0.77

Easy install, just pull the tabs from underneath while applying pressure with a credit card and I only had one small bubble. The claim for anti-fingerprint is GOOD! It will not prevent them 100%, but I haven't noticed barely any fingerprints since I put it on. I use to wipe it down twice a day with cloth, now once every two days.

Before I knew it, the compelling characters drew me in until I simply had to find out what would happen to them. If Tara was attempting to imitate the fairies' irresistible invitations, then she accomplished her goal.THE BADAlthough Taboo doesn't have a lot of back story info dump, which makes transitioning from the first book in the series to the second book very easy, had I not read Initiate first I think I would have been hard pressed to understand what was happening in Taboo.Also, as with Initiate, Taboo has a very abrupt ending.Imagine Star Wars: A New Hope ending with the Death Star blowing up -- no Darth Vader in his ship careening away, no big medal of honor ceremony. That is, more or less, how both Initiate and Taboo end.The fact that both Initiate and Taboo have such abrupt endings, and that Taboo has very little back story included, makes me think this series was actually written as a single book, then chopped into segments.THE OVERALLI enjoyed both books, though I don't know if I'll continue reading the series. (I hate feeling sucked into a never-ending story.) I would, however, highly recommend The Unfinished Song: Initiate and The Unfinished Song: Taboo to anyone who doesn't mind downloading the next book immediately to find out what happens next.",328,ANIZ7PU98M4M3,Good read if...,3,4.0,336,73.03,30.64,80.64,41.94,56.00,16.67,84.82,50.60,10.71,6.25,4.46,0.00,0.00,1.49,0.30,4.46,9.52,11.90,8.04,5.95,6.55,2.08,15.18,5.06,2.08,2.38,1.19,4.17,5.06,2.98,2.08,0.00,0.89,0.89,6.25,0.00,0.00,1.49,0.60,13.99,3.27,3.27,2.98,2.38,0.60,4.46,2.38,0.00,1.49,0.89,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.74,1.19,5.06,1.19,0.60,0.60,4.76,7.44,1.19,18.45,1.49,6.55,11.61,3.27,3.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.89,0.30,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.18,4.17,5.65,1.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.89,0.00,2.08,0.60,0.00

You can find a lot of examples of this vandalization by searching for ""th"" -- a ""the"" with the ""e"" removed.For example, one of the editors (Cory) posted a blog entry about his own story -- search for ""0wnz0red in Swedish"".  If you look at the comments for that story, anyone who said anything remotely not in favor of ""0wnz0red"" had his comment vandalized, which only the editors or people with the editor's permission can do.  You can also see someone at comment number 23 replying to a post from ""Tamara R"" that has apparently been deleted.  I don't know what she said, but I can guess.You can also find the Boing Boing post about the sale of their (at the time) $120 hoodie.  When people began complaining about the price, they put a ""moratorium"" on further complaints about the price.  Imagine if Amazon did that: advertised an item for sale and then limited the number of negative comments that could be made.  (We'll advertise it and you'll like it!  Or else!)Bottom line:Evidence suggests that if the Boing Boing editors had control over Amazon, this review right here would vanish and/or be vandalized by them, not because there's anything foul or incorrect in it, but simply because it's an opinion that they don't like (especially when it's a negative opinion leveled at a product that they like).Yes, you can argue that they have the right to do this -- it's their blog after all -- but for them to trumpet free speech and blast all forms of censorship on one hand and then ENGAGE in the very acts they publicly decry smacks of hypocrisy to me.

As a veteran of online dating, I did not find any earth shattering new tips or techniques - most of it amounts to common sense (i.e. post a recent picture that is clear, flattering, and smiling because men are visual creatures, wear red and present an hourglass shape - assuming it can be done - don't put out a list of too many criteria for what you are seeking in a man, present positively and interestingly, etc).  It did include a brief overview of some of the larger dating sites as well as her recommended smaller ""boutique"" sites. Scattered throughout the book were references to using her ""Love Mentoring"" service to enhance success with these techniques.As someone who has utilized online dating for some years - and obviously, not been completely successful or I wouldn't have purchased this book! - I have a difficult time seeing anything she recommends that I, as an average person, have not done independently.

Should you loose, receive a replacement Kindle (warranty or otherwise) or purchase a Kindle 2 ALL past issues of Newspapers or Magazines that were downloaded to the original Kindle will be UNREADABLE on any subsequent Kindle even though it is registered to your account.Think about this for a moment. You buy these periodicals and obtain the rights for your use, but if you purchase or replace your Kindle you have no further rights to read past issues YOU bought and paid for.One better hope that their Kindle never breaks because Amazon does not repair YOUR Kindle they replace it with another. Therefore no more use of your periodicals.Sound absurd? Well it is true. So much for a reference library.It is because of the Digital Rights Management (DRM) that is embedded in the file of the Newspaper or Magazine. It records the serial number of the original Kindle that the periodical was downloaded to.

They (finally) did, and so now I have a Kindle with a New Yorker subscription. As others have said, the New Yorker is a perfect candidate for Kindle - a ton of content that many of us get behind on but don't want to let go. The idea of carrying around a bunch of issues of the magazine without, well, carrying around a bunch of issues of the magazine - it's perfect! Unfortunately, while I'm glad to have any semblance of this magazine on the Kindle, we're not quite there. The lack of cartoons (and other non-text) content is one factor; another is the lack of a proper table of contents. The ""section list"" is simply useless. And while you can click one of the little numbers next to the sections and then page through the ""articles list,"" there is no way that I can find to simply jump to the articles list the way you can use the menu button to reach the table of contents on a Kindle book. When my print New Yorker arrives each week, the first thing I do is scan the table of contents: I want to see if my favorite writers have pieces in the new issue, I want to know the titles of the articles so I can flag which ones sound interesting.

While search can help when I'm hunting for, say, ""the one with the excerpt from DFW's unfinished novel,"" I'm not always possessed of terms to type into the little box. The Kindle edition's buried-in-the-interface ""articles list"" simply doesn't allow the kind of efficient triage that the print edition's table of contents makes effortless.

No, you don't get all of the cartoons from the print version, but you get a nice handful of them- accessed via clicking on the cartoonists' names at the end of the Articles List.  I was going to complain that the print version's cover (one of the most notable aspects of the magazine) isn't included in the Kindle version, but it is.  After a bit of investigation, I discovered that if you simply hit the previous page button after you're sent to the first page of the Articles List- voila!- you're shown the cover.  Don't know why they're being so cagey about it, but at least it's there.  Monthly subscription price is very good, too.  For the price I'm paying for each monthly issue of ""Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine"" on the Kindle, I'm getting four (and sometimes even five) full issues of ""The New Yorker"".  This was an easy buying decision.2/17/09 postscript: I see from my new issue of ""The New Yorker"" that they somewhat corrected the cover problem.  You're still not sent to the cover when you first open your new issue, but at least they're more clear that it's there. On the first page of the Articles List- the place you're still sent upon first opening your issue- there's now an entry for ""Cover"", which also helpfully includes the name of the artist who drew that week's cover, along with the title of the cover art.  Just click on the cover info and you're sent to the cover.  Or, as said before, you can still just hit the previous page button from the first page of the Articles List to get there, too.3/3/09 postscript (the final one, I promise):  Another new issue, another change.  This time, when I opened my newest issue (my first on my new Kindle 2), the first thing I saw was indeed the cover, so there you have it.  No selecting or clicking to see what by all rights SHOULD be the first thing one sees upon opening ""The New Yorker"".  Though (grumble) the cover is reproduced a little small, underneath the needless redundancy of the magazine's title floating above the magazine cover (redundant because the title is right there within the cover reproduction).

Consequently, when I go on a trip, I take a tall stack of New Yorkers with me.  This weighs down my luggageI initially thought that having a Kindle would enable me to substantially lighten my luggage by allowing me to dispense with all the heavy paper copies of The New Yorker that I usually carry with me.  But there is a problem with keeping numerous back issues of The New Yorker on the Kindle.Amazon will reload to your Kindle only the 7 most recent issues.  For example, if you are 25 weeks behind in reading The New Yorker (as I now am), and your Kindle breaks or is lost, Amazon will reload your Kindle with only the last 7 issues.  The other 18 issues would be lost.Backing up the issues is not an option.  Each issue is keyed only to a particular Kindle.  Consequently, if your Kindle breaks or is lost, the backup copies CANNOT be used on your new Kindle.  Your only option is to have Amazon send you reissues, which they will do only for the 7 most recent issues.This policy with respect to periodicals is in sharp contrast to the policy with respect to books.  Once you buy a Kindle book, you can always retrieve that book from Amazon.  I don't understand why Amazon doesn't allow us to retrieve all the periodicals we have purchased (in the same manner it allows us to retrieve all the books we have purchased).UPDATE (January 21, 2013):  All back issues of the iPad edition of The New Yorker (dating back to October 4, 2010) are available for download from Apple's App Store, not just the last seven issues.

The Kindle version should note this so folks won't be upset when they don't receive a new issue next week.2 - This print issue's cover is a fold out cover that has two panels.  The Kindle version shows only the first panel.  The second panel should have been included to get the rest of the joke.3 - All the sections are included in the Kindle version, but some of them are placed in a different order.  The ""Mail"" and all the poems are at the end of the Kindle version, as are all the cartoons.4 - Missing from the Kindle version is a 6-panel color cartoon essay by Bruce McCall.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  Transposing it to black & white would not have taken anything away from the cartoons.  Really, you can't leave Bruce McCall out of the New Yorker.I sorta miss the ads, the color photos, the little drawings, and I can always check out the color covers on line.

I think the magazine is a great value at even much higher price but please don't tell it to its publisher.The interface is easy-to-use though wish I knew how long the articles are before embarking on them. The article are all first-rate often written by the very best in their professions. (Now I am not related to this magazine.) The movie, theater, book critics - instead of marking them thumbs up or thumbs down - give detailed opinions and are fun to read. (I value its reviews than The New York Times ones.) The short stories, cartoons, poems, profiles and so on - one will always find a few articls of interest in each issue. I don't read everything - about half to three-fourth of the articles and it is good enough for me.I also got the audibook version from Audible (an Amazon company) that has over 2 hours of narrative each week and it too is a great value.I got Kindle mainly for enjoying material like The New Yorker and I am not disappointed. With recent outrageous prices of Kindle books (set by publishers) this magazine has become my main source of reading and I am happy about it.Must say though that while the articles' political tone is about neutral it is fact-based and as such the magazine might not be liked by right-wingers/tea-baggers/FOX-watchers and some will find it 'elitist.'",303,A3R7276W51F9FT,The Best.,2,5.0,314,67.02,23.20,43.80,95.88,31.40,17.52,85.03,52.23,12.74,6.05,5.10,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.96,6.69,7.01,14.33,8.28,6.05,7.01,1.59,14.97,7.64,3.82,0.64,1.91,2.55,6.37,5.41,0.64,0.00,0.32,0.32,4.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.06,2.23,2.23,0.64,2.23,1.59,4.78,0.96,0.32,0.64,0.00,1.27,0.64,0.00,0.00,0.32,4.78,0.32,1.27,2.55,2.23,0.00,2.23,10.19,1.27,8.60,0.00,3.82,4.78,4.14,3.50,0.00,0.96,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.56,4.46,1.91,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,3.82,0.00,2.23,3.18,0.64

But that's where the similarity ends. Wharton does not go in for incredibly long, tortured Jamesian sentences. Her prose is deceptively simple. But the book is DEEP.

He specifically absolved me of any responsibility, but I am happy to provide an honest review.Synopsis (from the flap): With a noose around his neck, Samuel arrives in a forest littered with caution tape and artifacts of the deceased. He struggles to regain his memory while fending off a pack of wolves and the mysterious visitors who seem to know more about this dying world than he does. Major, Kole, and Mara, his new companions also trapped in the strange locality, accompany Samuel and attempt to outrace its destruction, to outrun the Reversion.My Thoughts: Imagine an infinite number of realities, all vibrating at different speeds. Some are steady. Some are picking up speed. Some are slowing down. Some... are about to stop. Samuel has apparently stepped from one reality into another - this movement between realities seems to happen just prior to the point of death.In some ways this story reminds me of Stephen King's short story ""The Langoliers""; mainly the creeping cloud o' doom that leaves... nothingness in its wake. There is also a sense of recursiveness, especially toward the end, that reminded me of the Dark Tower series. So, basically what I'm saying is that this book reminded me a lot of Stephen King. It's all about the journey, about the creeping horror of individual moments, the long wait, the brief moments of terror, and then more waiting.

As an American, I enjoy reading news from a foreign perspective. Unlike so many of the UK papers, The Guardian is fair and mostly unbiased, but it does have a liberal sensibility, but that is refreshing when so many of the UK papers are homophobic and obsessed with religion and the C of E. A recent essay on the Falkland Islands conflict was one of the best things I have read lately about why Britain still defends the tiny South Atlantic archipelago. Most articles give both sides of the story: Tory and Labour.

B0016LG8QW,Kindle Store,"[21, 25]",3.0,0.68,3.2142857142857144,4.0,"We are going to China next Fall, so I thought I would try out the Shanghai Daily, an English newspaper published in China.I actually quite like it. As I write this the massive earthquake is still the top news, so the paper is steeped in reporting death tolls, survivor stories, etc. I certainly have been getting a more in-depth look at the aftermath of the earthquake than I get on the 30 second sound clips on the local news.What makes the paper 'interesting' is the editorial opinions. As you read these you realize that this paper must 'toe the line' with the ruling Communist Party.For instance, several US newspapers had written that due to China's ""one baby"" rule (a family cannot have more than one child) many married couples who lost their one child in the earthquake are devasted by, not only due to their losing their only child, but, due to age, they can no longer have any more children. To face old age in China without children is unthinkable.Yet the editorial piece in the Shanghai paper took the US papers to task, trying to be 'sarcastic', but with a noteable lack of success. The editor asked (paraphrase): ""Are the US papers suggesting that the sense of loss to a Chinese parent is lessened if they have two children and lose only one; or have three children and yet lose only one; or have four....""(you get the drift; they went up to TEN children). The piece did not make a lot of sense (I know I am reporting the piece very poorly), but the editorial completely, and knowingly I bet, missed the whole point of the US articles. Never once did the editor address the fact that older women would not be able to have another child. Rather, the editorial ended up praising the one-child rule.The paper is also interesting in how it reports the number of Chinese citizens thanking their leaders for all the help provided after the earthquake, or how a child in some province was urging people to donate 10 cents apiece; or how a businessman shamed his family by only offering 100,000 huan to the victims, representing only 1 percent of his wealth, etc.The paper also reports US sports (it is a newspaper for people who speak English living in China, much like the Paris Tribune) and entertainment. It was rather a shock, in my first Kindle issue, to finish reading about the structural damage to various dams in western China, then 'flip' the page to see a headline about Angelina Jolie expecting twins.I'm not sure why I am giving four stars rather than five. I guess because I sense I will probably grow tired of it after a while (especially after I return from China and the novelty has worn off).Edited to Add: Another 'editorial' addressed some of the critics who say that the reason China's leaders have been so 'open' about the earthquake is because of the uncoming Olympics; that they feel pressure to be transparent about the earthquake, victims, etc. The person writing the editorial says that the critics are wrong! How did he prove this? He wrote (again, paraphrase from memory): ""They are so wrong! I went to the Vice Premier of the People's Communist party and he assured me that the critics are wrong!"" Ah, proof indeed!Again, while many of the 'editorials' seem to have been written by High School students taking a journalism class, many of the news pieces are very, very information. Indeed, some of the news pieces about American politics are more informative than the sound bites we tend to get from our news sources.",608,AY54QSGO3KWEM,English Edition is.....Interesting,3,4.5,625,82.90,67.86,21.76,14.68,36.76,18.40,86.40,50.88,10.56,6.88,2.88,1.28,0.48,0.80,1.44,3.68,10.72,12.80,7.52,6.40,4.96,1.28,15.04,4.32,3.04,1.44,3.20,4.16,4.96,2.08,2.88,0.32,0.00,0.96,10.56,0.80,0.00,0.16,0.80,11.52,2.08,1.76,1.44,2.72,2.08,3.52,1.76,0.32,0.80,0.16,0.48,0.16,0.32,0.00,0.00,11.52,2.88,2.40,4.96,1.44,1.28,3.36,9.44,0.64,10.08,0.96,4.48,4.64,5.92,0.96,0.48,0.96,0.00,0.16,0.80,0.00,0.32,0.48,0.16,0.00,16.96,4.00,5.12,0.16,0.80,0.16,0.64,0.32,0.96,2.88,1.92,0.00

The stories are included in their entirety, sometimes with pictures.

If you love books and are always on the lookout for new reading material, this is the perfect magazine for you. Some of the books they review might seem too specialized at a first glance. Keep reading the reviews, however, and you will discover that the amazing reviewers who write for TLS can make any topic sound engaging and fascinating.I haven't had any problems with the Kindle format of TLS.

There is a lot of content and the many stories have been quite good.  However, as a woman, some of the stories strike me as RATHER IMMATURE.  Not all, but enough, of the stories have a teenaged boy's perspective on sexuality and women in particular.  This is something which plagues science fiction altogether, but when you pick up a book (or sample one on Kindle) in which the writer's understanding of the human condition is so obviously juvenile, you can just put it down and choose something else.  With this, I sometimes feel as if I am paying a monthly fee for puerile drivel.  I guess I am, at that.Another problem I seem to have is - it is, at this writting, Sept 9th.  I was in the middle of the last issue, when, suddenly, that issue was gone and I have now been delivered of the Nov. 1st issue.  I can't seem to find the previous issues anywhere and am going to contact Amazon to find out if every month the previous issues are erased.  If so, I am canceling my subcription.  I don't like the idea of paying for something and then being timed on reading it.  This is the only magazine I get on Kindle, so maybe I just don't know how it works.Anyway, if I can find the previous issues, I will keep this subscription for another couple of months and see if the stories tend more toward intelligent writing, or bordering on soft porn aimed only at adolescent boys and sophomoric men.  Just bordering, but enough that it takes the fun out of the reading for me.  Skip to the next article!**Okay, I just read all about how magazine periodicals are managed.

I mean, ""The Sushi Chronicles""? Really? Why don't I write a book about a Japanese exchange student in the US and call it ""The McDonalds Chronicles"" because it is a well known fact that all Americans eat McDonalds all the time.Unlike Anne Van--who, according to her bio, speaks Japanese and only lived in Japan for two years--I not only have a BA centered around Japanese studies, but I have lived here in Japan for almost a decade and am /fluent/ (between ILR Level 4 and 5; in other words, I have near native fluency) in the language. While I do not claim to be an expert on Japanese history or culture, I have enough academic and real, lived experience to say with confidence that Tokyo Dare shows a warped, racist perspective of Japan and Japanese culture shaped from Anne Van's outsider's perspective.The language choice in the summary is one that exoticizes Japan for a Western audience: the sushi references and calling it ""the Land of the Rising Sun"" in particular are lazy stereotypes that evoke Japan for a largely ignorant Western audience. The terms of address for the host family (""Papasan"" and ""Mamasan"") are the kind of mangled, half-understood Japanese that is frequently used by people who call everything ""kawaii"" and put ""desu"" on the end of their sentences. I have a hard time believing that a host family would ask to be addressed by those names.Which brings me to the next red flag about this book: the racist stereotype of ""crazy"" Japanese people. Ever since shows like /Most Extreme Elimination Challenge/ came out, Westerners have loved to point to Japanese TV (and even some Japanese products) and condescendingly laugh about how ""crazy"" those Japanese are. By using Erin's ""crazy"" host family as a pivotal and appealing plot point Anne Van is pandering to people who enjoy pointing and laughing at people who are different than them.It's entirely possible that the book itself shows a lot more cultural understanding and sensitivity than the description, but why should I take that gamble? I have no desire to waste my time on a book that has shown lots of evidence of being written by a woman with only a passing familiarity with Japan and who is more interested in pandering to a Western readers' ignorant stereotypes about Japan than in actually writing a book that encapsulates the complexities of foreigners living in Japan.2013/9/21 EDIT: First, let me state that I was wrong to take Anne Van at face value when she said that she spoke Japanese. The VERY BASIC Japanese in the book is mangled to the point of being gibberish. Honestly, I don't understand how she got through the classes that I am sure were mandatory during her two year exchange at Waseda. If you spend two years taking Japanese classes and living in Japan and don't even know how to say, ""I don't speak English"" then you lose any credibility if you say that you speak Japanese.Also, after having read a few pages, I can safely say that the book does NOT show more cultural sensitivity or understanding than the description. The description was a 100% accurate reflection of Anne Van's horribly racist views on Japan.BUYER BEWARE, ANNE VAN IS NOT--I REPEAT--NOT AN EXPERT ON JAPAN.

Let's just say I COULD NOT get though this book on how terrible it was.The ""thanks"" in the foreword was a list of Western names, with a ""thanks"" to the Japanese people for providing ""fun. Yes this book IS racist if you were still wondering. The first page has "" Ego no hansimasu!"" which is gibberish in Japanese, and YES this was supposedly a Japanese person saying this. Notice the space too... yeah, this book had an editor and proofreaders so.. someone was sleeping on the job. Of course it never had a JAPANESE proofreader. Otherwise that gibberish would be corrected so we can understand the person was saying ""I don't speak English."" Two years in Japan and the author doesn't even know how to say ""I don't speak English!"" properly, yet she write a whole book set in the country.Foremost this is a fetishized viewpoint of Japan, this isn't what Japanese is really like. Despite living 2 years in Japan the author seems to have learnt nothing and wants to paint Japan as ""Craaaazzy!"" (Yay abelism) You should read her blog, she talks about wanting to strangle a woman because she isn't giving the author the information she wants fast enough. Yes, the author wrote that she wanted to strangle another human being because she feels she's entitled to harass a person in Japan about local customs and if they don't answer her fast enough with the information she wants. That is the mindset of the author.The chapter 1 title of ""The Alien Has Landed"" is apt to the point of yes the MC is an invader to Japan.The first thing the MC runs into is the Coke bot vending machine. I hear vending machines like that are a gimmick and you'll probably only see like.. a few around. Anyways, she I guess falls to the ground or something and this guy comes up and doesn't help her. Yeah no, not happening in Japan. Then she opens her water bottle and gets it splashed onto her shirt so the author can write that she's wearing a black lace bra, this is the ONLY time water splashes on her. Some RANDOM person has a video camera to tape her. Yeah, THAT ALSO isn't happening, especially since the next time all of this happens is in McDonald's where she both splashes her drink on her, burps loudly and RANDOM CAMERA MAN!! Oh and Japanese people seem to speak ""Janglish"".I should also note they call the counselor ""Mr. Shinji."" YOU NEVER CALL A SUPERIOR BY THEIR FIRST NAME. Yes, Shinji is a first name.I tried to finish the book but with the broken pacing and broken characterization (Erin Van -> Anne Van. I see what you did there!) I just really couldn't, I've read other horrible books but this was just unreadable.This Japan does not exist. This is what a rich entitled white racist viewpoint (self insert power fantasy) Japan looks like. If you really want to know what Japan is like, go read books written by people from Japan and not from someone who spent only 2 years there in an exchange program.

The magazine also states the word length of each story, especially helpful to help the reader determine if he/she has time to read through the whole thing in one sitting.I have been a subscriber for years to the print edition, but have also read the magazine in several e-book formats.  The Kindle was by far the best option of all, with the only drawback being the terrible formatting.  With this new edition, all the reasons to hold off on subscribing to this longest running science fiction magazine for your Kindle have been removed.

It is rare they publish a story that I do not enjoy and the variety is exciting.  There are usually 3+ short stories (around 6k words) and a couple longer ones (15k words).  Great for filling the time on breaks, relaxing before bed, or escaping the real world for a few.  The 8 standard issues have 3-5 hours of material depending on how fast you read, and 2x a year there are huge double issues.I was a little unsure of the Kindle edition because of all the bad reviews, but after a couple issues I see they were all unfounded, nit-picking, or out of date.1) Even publisher confirmed that the paper and digital price are about the same.  So it is a buck more for a year for the Kindle edition if you paid annually -- who cares?!?!  I think the tiny markup is worth it for the Kindle convenience, lack of ads, and paper savings.2) The formatting is just fine.  There is the occasional un-needed hyphenation or two words pushed together, but you see even in the Kindle editions of best selling books.3) The menus are easy to use and the same that most publishers have adopted since the Kindle 2 came out.  They break it out into short stories, novellas, novelettes and fact/readers sections, each with 1-4 articles.  The only downside to this layout is that you don't have location numbers, but for a 30-page story it isn't too hard to find your place if you lose it by accidentally pressing the 5-way.For me, $2.99 a month is a great deal for 6-10 great stories/articles and a few hours of reading.

Typically there are some Novellas, Novellettes and short stories in an issue, and a few fact articles. All are excellent.Now that its available with subscription via Kindle for Android, I thought I'd try this version. Other reviews gave me a clue there might be problems, so I bought a single issue, rather than a subscription. It has a major flaw: it always opens at the contents page. The app can't remember where I stopped reading last.  Stories are typically 5,000 to 20,000 words, and I read in snatches: on a bus or tram, over coffee, in a queue at the supermarket: whatever. I rarely finish a story in one session.

Next, I noticed it was based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs- of Tarzan fame? No way, I thought. So, when my family bought me a tablet for Christmas, I decided to look for it. At the ridiculous price of $0.00, I bought it. I am now on the third of his series of books. What is so interesting for me is that this series talks to the future in the same manner of Jules Verne or H.G. Wells. He published this first book in 1917 I believe. Flight was a very young idea back then. He deals with it in a very delightful and adventurous manner, along with other ideas that I am sure stretched the imagination. And that is the point. I was used to the idea of seeing Johnny Weissmuller swinging through the jungle belting out his Tarzan yell and summoning all his animal friends in the jungle to confront &#34;man&#34; and save the day. Here was a man transported to the planet Mars to interact with many types of beings and many forms of their beliefs. In a wonderful salute to parody, Burroughs alludes to human civilization and its beliefs and faith in those beliefs in a delicate manner. On Mars for instance, one creatures Heaven may be another creatures dinner! Read it and see.I want to add one entirely different remark. At a older age now, it is difficult for me to focus for longs periods of time on print. These tablets are something to consider. You can adjust the print size or font and the background you read it on. The Amazon Kindle Store is remarkable. When you download a book of choice it is delivered to you by &#34;Whispernet&#34;, which fantastically comes to you in less than a minute!!!! Most of these books are at reduced prices. I have a Samsung tablet, so I know the Kindle app works on it. I do really think taking a look at those Kindle Fires might be worthy of a glance. They are dedicated to this reading structure and I heard they do not make a bunch on the tablets. They are interested in making money on the Amazon platform. So, the tablets are well made for the money.

In this light, they have decided to pick and choose which artilces digital subscribers get to see.  Last week, there was ONE (1)!!! article on the front page?  Really?  The physical paper had four!  On another day the arts section had only three articles.  The physical paper had seven. Ms. Cabot's articles are sometimes missing from the sports pages. The things they do include, (like their lame PDQ section), is useless since it is mostly graphs--and the PD does not digitize graphs at all.  Imagine how irritating it is to read a list of questions asked on current issues with no list of answers or demographics included. As for pictures, you're lucky to get one per issue.  This is NOT a digital newspaper that Cleveland can be proud of.Update July 2012:  The people at the PD have not improved their digital edition. Careless errors abound.  Frequently you will find articles repeated--whole sections of the newspaper presented twice. You'll only see a specific location listed once, but when you get to the end of the section, the articles all repeat. They have added more photos, but they are frequently attached to the wrong articles. Example:  on July 8 the first article in the business section dealt with wind power, but the accompanying photo was of a Cleveland Indians player. Another thing that has begun to happen with regularity is whole articles being located in the wrong section.  (Sunday's edition included the NYTimes Best Seller list, but put it in the Sports Section.) ...And they still insist on including the PDQ section without any graphics.

Being a life-long Clevelander, I'm used to being left for last or left out completely. I perused the Kindle version this morning and found all sections accounted for. There aren't really any photos to speak of, but that's the world we live in these days. I subscribe to several Kindle magazines and the photos are sparse if at all.It would be nice if the sections were divided into folders. I know we're only on Kindle version 2.3. Let's hope folders are next; both for organizing our books and within magazines and newspapers. For now, this will be fine.I'm also glad to be part of the solution, folders or not.

The author's libertarian bias is clear, but it's still not as blatantly preachy as the absolutely horrible first part. Had the story just consisted of the second part, it would have earned two or three stars.But the first part drops it down to one star, especially one scene where a history teacher lectures about how horrible the world was until a constitutional amendment was adopted that made it so that it was illegal to pass laws, only repeal them, whereafter that, things only got better.If it was adopted purely as a plot device in a fictional story, the lecture would be more tolerable. But Smith has a website seriously advocating such an amendment, and he apparently thinks that repealing the laws would create a stable, prosperous society.The book itself and Smith's philosophy reveals the ugly, selfish, reactionary views that make up extreme libertarianism, of people who have never felt true oppression or discrimination complaining about services that are truly pitiful. Libertarian complaints about 'police states' pale in comparison to the experiences of true police states like Myanmar or North Korea, and their complaints about taxation pale in comparison to the plight of countless millions who live in utter poverty.Extreme libertarians come across as spoiled overgrown children who whine about persecution without truly experiencing it, and this book is that philosophy shown in all of its glory.",273,AGZYV6KU002SQ,Mary Sue fluff,3,1.0,278,66.88,42.85,11.10,25.77,55.60,24.46,82.73,49.64,10.79,1.44,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.36,0.72,9.35,8.27,12.59,7.55,7.55,7.91,1.44,11.51,7.91,4.68,1.80,3.96,3.24,7.91,3.96,3.96,0.72,0.36,0.72,5.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.36,14.75,1.44,2.16,1.44,2.52,4.32,5.40,3.60,1.44,0.72,0.72,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,6.47,0.00,2.16,3.96,1.08,0.36,3.24,6.47,0.00,8.27,1.08,4.68,2.52,5.04,1.08,0.00,1.08,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,12.95,3.60,6.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.72,2.16,0.00,0.00

It is a classical tale of good versus evil.  In the aftermath of the War of the Dragons, the rebel dragons led by Obsidian are amassing their power with the intent of extinguishing all forms of life.  The hopes of the humans, elves, and Dragons of Light are centered on two unlikely characters.  Nachal is a human who was raised by dragon-kind, and Auri is an elf who was raised by humans.  They enter on a journey of self-discovery to try to understand their strange heritage and upbringing and to understand their role of destiny in the upcoming battle for existence.This book has an engaging plot and likeable characters. It was generally well-written with a good blend of action, suspense, and humor.  There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the reader's interest. As with most self-published books, this one needs some editing.  The major flaw that I found with the book is in the emotional content.

I specifically did not want your typical cooking mag that was nothing more than a magazine full of recipes, ads, and fluf. Rather, I wanted a magazine that actually taught you about cooking, a magazine that actually got into the science of cooking; a cooking reference in a periodical. Cook's Illustrated is actually that. It is an amazing cooking reference that keeps on giving issue after issue; one that you may even consider taking notes on while reading. The writers are not just chefs, they are cooking scientists that explain exactly how they came up with their recipes and the science behind them. And, the best part is the fact that you ultimately benefit from the fruits of their labor by getting the complete recipe after they have worked out all the kinks. But, if you are interested in more than just recipes, like I was, you will be pleased to find plenty of articles on other very informative topics. In short, this is by far the very best cooking periodical in my opinion. The illustrations are fantastic and the black and white photography adds an element of class.

On the other hand, this book contains techniques discovered by using critical thinking skills to solve real world issues.  It is not a regurgitation of the help file!It is well written and does not require the user to read it in sequential order.  The lucid explanation of array formulas demystifies this esoteric feature of Excel that few people can grasp.  For anybody seeking to learn array formulas, this book will put them on the fast-track to being an array formula guru.  Ctrl-Shift-Enter has become my favorite Excel key combination since reading this book.In addition to array formulas, this book contains a treasure trove of charting techniques, pivot table tips and tricks, VBA techniques and a vast array of other ""neat"" tricks.  The VBA code examples covered do not have fluff such as tutorials on error handling, explanations of variable declaration and things of that nature. Although these topics are important, one does not need a book to learn them as it can be found online or by hitting the F1 key for help.  However, it contains a wealth of neat VBA tricks that cannot be found by looking at the help file.Reading this book has helped me become a more critical thinker.

Theoretically, this could have been a good concept, but the execution was not there at all.Tabitha was one of the most one-dimensional characters I have ever read. Her thoughts had one tone: superior. Even when she was supposedly happy and loving things, she just seemed so full of herself. She pretty much thought everyone was beneath her because she had been all over the world and understood the ""real world"" and assumed that American high school kids would be like what she had seen watching 90210. She was worried about other people judging her, but every thought she had was judgmental, even about her supposed best friend. Whenever she was supposedly crushing on Alex (that was his name right?), it never seemed sincere.Speaking of what's his name, that was like the worst relationship ever. As soon as she gets a boyfriend, Tabitha went from ""how soon can I leave?"" to ""please, don't make me go!"" I don't believe the L word was never used, for which I am glad, because I give them a week tops before Alex realizes that she is absolutely crazy and dumps her.

There are huge advantages to getting/producing kindle versions of medical journals, and I expect these advantages will become so obvious in the near future that nearly all journals will move to this format.  What are the advantages?1) Conservation.  Right now there are literally ""metric tons"" of medical journals stacked all over doctors homes and offices and medical libraries around the world.  Most of the journals just sit there unopened 99% of the time (not mine of course :-)).  Seems like a real waste of paper, ink, and real estate.  Why not just allow doctors subscribe to journals electronically on ereaders and access them on an ""as needed"" basis.  Think of all the paper/ink/space that would be saved. No need to tie up and recycle your old journals at the end of the month!2) Convenience.  How nice would it be to simply carry around an ereader that could fit in your white coat pocket and offer all the worlds medical journals/articles at your finger tips. Wouldn't need a computer handy.  Wouldn't need to print anything out.  Come to think of it, once all the world's medical journals arrive on the kindle, it'd be nice to have PUBMED easily accessible on the kindle for search purposes.3) The kindle version of the JACC is about as easy to read as the paper version.

I enjoyed getting to know the characters.Brother Half Angel appeared again in this book and--to put it in the colloquial--he's a piece of work! The least perfect hero one might ever encounter--and yet such an effective one.Luiz makes a good addition to the military order. He's quite different from Brother Half Angel, yet someone I definitely look forward to seeing more of in future books.I liked having The Maria Kannon and Brother Half Angel set in different countries. That helped to keep me from getting the details mixed up between books.The information Martin provides about the setting is an integral part of the story, and that helped to draw me in more.Martin's Military Order series has been a wonderful read.

DailyKos is mostly populated by progressives of all stripes, from left to right. Thanks to its site-wide ranking system, where every member can vote for or against diaries (individual entries) they think add something to the conversation, the cream of the crop tends to float to the top. It is this cream that is downloaded throughout the day to your Kindle, replete with links to significant sites and original material for further exploration.For a one-stop shop of what's really going on on the left AND the right, you can't do better than to start with DailyKos. The most up-to-date information often hits here hours or days before you find it mentioned anywhere else, and it's interesting to see what the cable news shows do (and do not) pick up on.""Kossacks,"" as the members call themselves -- an ironic fun-poking at uninformed people who believe it when they are told these people are communists -- are an independent, spirited bunch with wide-ranging interests, talents, and employments. Hardly ""just a bunch of kids,"" many are professional people (even some famous ones), and most of the diarists who rise to prominence behave professionally no matter what their age. Sincere and honest glimmers of personality shine through, however, which gives the writing a spirit, depth, and humanity that you'll never find in homogenized, regurgitated talking-points fare.Sure, you're going to get politics here (and in-depth analyses you just won't find elsewhere), but you also will find an incredible array of diaries covering everything from issues of national and international import to touching personal stories. For example, I started my day out today reading ""In Honor of My Departed Friend: A Brief Tale of Love and Loss,"" Redstateresident's loving and beautiful tribute to his dog Mobley who just passed away. (Having old dogs myself, Mobley's story really touched my heart.) Diverse people write about what they are passionate about, and so you get a wide array of well-researched, well-written information. Some are super-serious, some are laugh-out-loud funny. Kind of like Keith Olbermann...who occasionally pops into the mix.I LEARN about new things almost every day on DailyKos. Think of the Kindle subscription as a portal into a much larger world. You will have to turn on the wireless to pursue links to online material, whether it's non-Kos sites or links to the ""High Impact Diaries"" and choice comments compiled by each day's ""Rescue Rangers"" (who monitor the universe so you don't have to). However, most of the day's best material is downloaded to your Kindle for off-line consumption, so you'll be able to read ""Your Abbreviated Pundit Round-up"" (a pointed, sometimes hilarious summation of what the media biggies have written that day) in the lead-lined hospital waiting room. If you want to follow links to the original articles, just turn on the wireless.The only thing I DO NOT LIKE about my DailyKos subscription is that, for some reason, the type is very much smaller than all the other sites I go to. I have to set my Kindle type up on four or five to be able to read it, and then bump it back down if I follow a link to another web site. I think they must have the type size hard-coded so a user's settings can't override it. If somebody with the power to change it reads this, please fix it.

These looked great and they were a lightning deal so I went for it.I like the retro look and feel of these headphones. The description says ""genuine Bubinga wood"" although when I first got them I thought that the wood grain looked like it was printed on the wood. They were extra shinny when I took them out of the box and this gave the wood a plastic look at first.I'm still not 100% sure if the wood grain is real - but they still look awesome.I put them on for a couple of hours and tested them out on various audio samples. My first impression over all is that they are great. They are not the best sounding set I've ever tried - but still very, very good. Deep, rich sounding headphones that you can tell sound a lot better than a cheap pair.While watching movie trailers, the rich sound that these can produce made me feel like I was actually inside a theater with THX certified sound.I did get the headphones to buzz a bit when playing songs with a lot of bass on a high volume setting.These headphones sound about the same as some of the $50-60 pairs I've had - Although I like the way these sound a little more, not sure why yet, they do sound a little different (might be the wood housings)COMFORT:These have nice padded triangular shaped ear pads and pivoting heads, although after wearing them for a while I started to get a little ""headphone fatigue."" The pivot point of the ear piece I think is a little high and causes them to pinch or place most of the pressure on the lower part of the ear piece, instead of evenly distributing the weight across the whole ear. Not terrible, just wanted to note this. These are not as comfortable as my wife's ""Beats."" So far I think ""Beats"" are the most comfortable pair I've ever tried, although at a fraction of the cost these Tribecas are almost as good.FINAL THOUGHT:I bought these for the look. I like to think that I paid for a quality set of nice sounding headphones and paid a little extra to have them look cool. Maybe that sounds dumb, but I have plenty of black plastic looking headphones that look like clutter on a desk. These look so good they almost make a statement without being plugged in....ok maybe I'm going a little far... bottom line - I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend these to someone else.",481,A8ZDAGIZUMC,Great Sound - Better look,5,5.0,493,74.32,25.15,71.13,97.03,32.87,13.79,88.03,52.94,14.60,9.33,6.09,0.00,0.41,0.00,2.84,5.27,10.14,12.58,6.49,5.48,6.29,1.22,16.23,8.72,4.06,1.01,1.22,3.85,7.10,6.09,1.01,0.20,0.20,0.41,4.87,0.41,0.00,0.41,0.00,11.56,2.03,1.22,1.01,2.64,1.01,4.46,7.91,3.45,3.65,0.81,1.62,1.22,0.20,0.00,0.20,6.90,0.61,1.42,2.43,3.04,0.00,4.67,8.92,0.41,12.78,0.81,7.51,4.46,1.01,0.81,0.00,2.03,0.00,0.00,1.01,0.20,0.20,0.61,0.00,0.00,14.40,6.09,2.23,0.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.01,2.03,1.42,0.41,0.41

Oh well im dropping another star for Quality Control, and these are going back to Amazon tomorrow.Having spent a considerable amount of time in the high end audio industry I wasn't really expecting much out of these, I just wanted something for listening to music or to watch a movie on my Samsung GS3 or my Nexus 10 Tablet.  I wanted something that was a step up from boring looking, over the ear without looking like I am directing jets to taxi at an airport should I decide to wear them in public, something lightweight, and diminutive in size, but not anemic in the bass, or tinny or up tilted & bright sounding in the highs, and erring on the side of a warm mid-range.  I figured the wood would give them this warmth region boost similar to Grados and relatively speaking, on the cheap.  These look great out of the box, cabling is cloth sheathed with wood making up the support and strain relief for the quick disconnects for each can. They are very light, and I sort of knew they really would be pretty comfortable the minute they went on my head so easily and without pressing against my ears.There are not bright sounding. They are not even a little bright.  They are warm and rich in the mids.  The highs are either a bit recessed or the mids, mid-bass and deep bass are so pronounced as to subdue the highs.  I went into my DSP on my GS3 Android running CM10 ROM & gently created a custom eq with a mild up-tilt slope from Flat/0db in the upper-midrange region out to 20Khz where I was up around 3db.  Very gentle nothing too major. Seemed to shut my analytical mind up long enough to listen for an hour while I tried to focus on writing this review in real-time.These things really surprised me.  They produce very prodigious bass, and more detailed and defined bass with out the ""one note"" beats audio sounding bass that lack definition.  If you like tubes and midrange, you will love the shy highs overshadowed by the overstated lows and chocolaty rich mid-range.I played Armin Van Buuren's ""In & out of Love"" & it was so slamming I had to stop typing & break it down with some movement as by this point I had little choice in the matter.Next, I played both the original & the Verve Remix of Nina Simone's ""Sinner Man"".  The original puts the remix to shame which is poorly mastered and obnoxiously puts Nina's voice into background nearly behind the curtain and outside the building.  The separation of instruments and depth of stage of the original was very aptly presented, but was it superb? No, but it's enjoyable even if it its not exemplary.  Musical enough to enjoy it.I did notice some woody resonating sounds from the intro guitar plucks in Tracy Chapman's ""Remember the Tin Man"".  It was not the highlight of my audition of these cans.  The sound reminds you of poorly braced speakers that resonate certain frequencies with unpleasant dissonance that obscures everything.  ""The Promise"" & ""Cold Feet"" were both quite enjoyable to listen to.  I think with some minor tweaks these can be very competent and enjoyable to listen to.  They are not beyerdynamics, but they are practical and overall a reasonable priced product that is classy, reasonably well made, comfortable, and musical enough to get you into the gestalt of the music and out of your own head long enough to enjoy the sound on an emotional level.I will follow up after I get a better handle on the sound and see if there are any other chinks in the armor.I took off a star just because they are not neutral, but will say i would rather have a warm mid-range and good bass than a anemic low end and bright sounding top end with a buried mid-range.I feel like I will end up taking another star off, but at this price it's really hard to punish these things to much.  Rarely do headphones get me into the music, and in the end that's really all that matters.--Jonathan Carcopo",739,A3L1KS76F47MHQ,"UPDATED: QUALITY ISSUE IN ONE OF THE EARPHONE JACK..

It's clear the writer is a novice, but one that has great potential. For a free book I can't complain! I've read some HORRIBLE books by young indie authors but this is by far one of the best I've come across. Unfortunately, so many poorly written books are available now because self publishing and independent writing is much easier thanks to technology. That's why detailed and helpful reviews are important. Despite the spelling and grammar errors this book kept my attention. One other reviewer complained about the use of ""Anyways"". That, I didn't have a problem with - this is a young adult novel, and young adults use very poor grammar and commonly use ""anyways"" as an accepted word. That I felt was just the author identifying with the audience and being age appropriate with how her main characters talk. It's more so the sentence fluency, structure and spelling errors that tend to bother me - which wasn't THAT big of a problem here. Though the Colton relationship was annoying, as others have said, it's very typical for teenagers and young adults to act like they were and be that immature. The fact that the relationship annoyed me means that it was well developed - at least it made me FEEL something. I even shed a few tears for the main character at one point. I connected with many of the characters in the book and was rooting for them at the end.Despite the lack of writing experience this author may have, she was able to tell a great story in a way that kept me coming back for more. Grammar skills are easy to learn - great story telling is not. Her character and story development was well done and she has me anxiously waiting for the next book in the series. That, for a young self published author, is a huge accomplishment.

I have also visited the magazine's discussion group forum on its subscriber site.  So, I am familiar with the magazine and how its editorial staff conducts itself in internet discussions.  My personal background is as a trial attorney, and my undergraduate background was in physics.  I have spent years studying philosophy, science, history, etc., and am not a novice to philosophy and its methods by any means.  I just wanted people to know my background and experience with this magazine, so one would know the basis for my remarks.  First of all, the magazine is always late, so don't count on getting the current monthly issue for at least an additional month.  The quality of the articles is poor, and it is not clear to me if anyone who writes for the magazine actually has a background in philosophy, science, history, or any of the subject areas that they comment on.  As an example of the overly simplistic thinking this magazine endorses, there is a running column from one author who flops around from making the claim that morality exists, and then claims morality does not exist.  His solution to the abortion issue is to just let the people involved work it out.  The author is seemingly unaware of the likelihood that the ""people involved,"" may not be able to reach an agreement, and the major issue with abortion is whether the unborn child has any standing at all.  Does the unborn child count or not?  Apparently, overlooking such moral issues is considered to be a sign of brilliance on the part of the author and the editorial staff.  If one has a serious interest in philosophy, then one would be better off looking elsewhere.  Do not even get me started on the magazine's discussion group.  There, Rick Lewis himself publicly stated that the claim by one user, that the ""Jews control the entire US economy and the banks,"" was NOT anti-semitic.  The editors of this magazine seem to have a great deal of sympathy for anti-semitism, American-bashing, socialism, racism, sexism, etc., as evidenced by the membersship they promote in its forum discussion group.  Anyone wanting to support this magazine, should be aware that the editorial staff has the ""intellectual"" level of what one may find on numerous hate sites throughout the net.

B00FM6E8PU,Kindle Store,"[51, 51]",3.0,1.0,4.741935483870968,5.0,"""President Fionn"" is a layered character novel sharing with us the life of a young boy named Fionn, who is a gentle daydreamer who loves to read. He lives in Dublin with his mother and sister, abandoned by his father, and he is surrounded by a colorful family. His mother pushes his sister to marry a man she doesn't love for a secure future, and Fionn idolizes his grandfather despite some indications that he's not as perfect as Fionn wants him to be. However, his grandfather does have one excellent trait--he believes in Fionn and insists the young man will grow up to be president of America.When Fionn is shocked by his childhood innocence by a chain of violence, he remains a dreamer, but one who is detached and removed from most life situations. As an adult, he returns to the scene of his childhood, dealing with unsavory and ungrateful family members; he also fixates on President Kennedy--the charisma and message of hope the man brings, something that Fionn desperately need--and follows the leader around Ireland, waiting to be noticed.The strength and great interest of ""President Fionn"" is in its characters; while the plot is interesting and keeps the pages turning, it is Fionn himself who provides the heart of the book and engages the reader's empathy and sympathy. He is a complex, likeable character who invokes pity at times and hope at others, especially in his adult years. Fionn's mother, sister, and other family members are also multifaceted and almost come alive off the page, while Father Mahey is a cold and chilling villain in the way he preys on others. I would recommend this novel to those who enjoy character studies, coming of age novels, and novels set during the Kennedy era.",294,A3K1FJNOECNX8R,Compelling Characters that Live Off of the Page,8,5.0,299,78.69,95.57,1.19,80.36,37.38,23.75,86.29,50.84,13.04,7.69,0.33,0.33,0.00,7.02,0.00,5.35,8.70,13.71,6.69,2.34,9.03,0.67,12.71,4.35,1.34,2.34,0.67,0.67,8.36,5.69,2.68,0.33,0.33,0.67,20.07,4.68,0.33,2.34,9.36,7.02,1.00,0.00,1.67,2.01,0.67,2.34,0.67,0.33,0.00,0.33,2.34,0.33,1.34,0.00,0.00,10.03,5.35,0.67,3.34,0.67,0.33,0.67,10.70,2.01,12.37,2.34,4.68,5.35,3.01,3.34,1.00,0.00,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.05,3.34,6.35,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,2.01,1.34,1.34,0.00,0.00

A real gem of a novel, this book celebrates the human spirit's ability to triumph through belief and creativity. Fionn is a charismatic character that I related to a lot. The author captures the daydreamy quality of childhood very well.  He lives in Dublin with his mother and sister and was abandoned by his father. The complex way we see his grandfather --through Fionn's loving eyes is only part of the story, but an important one, because the way his grandfather believes in Fionne is life-defining and a real reminder that we can positively impact others by having faith in them.Fionn's life in Ireland is harrowing in many ways, and the visceral impact of that is well told. Having President Kennedy enter the story was a brilliant and captivating premise. As the personification of the better aspects of the American Dream coming back to visit his ancestral homeland, by focusing on President Kennedy Fionn is able to do the same in a sense...tap into and reclaim inspiration and the best aspects of his family as he find his way to his own internal homecoming by chasing after Kennedy.

A place I never knew I wanted to go but one that I longed to go back to five minutes after I finished the book. I can't remember the last time a book has so completely transported me to a different time and place. The world that Ms. Flemming has created will stick with me for a long while and I couldn't be happier about it. I find the best books contain characters we can connect with and relate to. The speed with which Ms. Flemming is able to establish a connection between the reader and Fionn is seriously impressive. This book is emotional, so be prepared to put your whole heart into it. This is not a lollipop and merry-go-round tinted revisiting of one's youth, but rather a very honest examination of a young boy being introduced to the world in a very harsh way. Watching Fionn as he comes to understand that he will always have to navigate through the good and bad in life, and then the subsequent realization that he has the strength to do so, is heart-warming and inspiring. Fionn is a good kid that will grow into a good man, but not without a lot of pain, hardship, loss, and hard work. Those he trusts most betray him and basically abandon him when he needs them the most. Those who would help don't know how.

At the beginning Fionn is on his way back to Dublin after spending the best part of his life in the country. He has the right to be uncomfortable about returning, as he has some bad memories to face there. Times have changed and Fionn is a fish out of water, but when President Kennedy arrives in Dublin, in the June of that year, things start to happen for him in an almost mythical fashion.

His passion and imagination combine with his troubled reality and spiritual connection to the young American president to create a remarkable journey of growth of change.I was pretty amazed at the ability of the author to build such a deep character in Fionn.

The juxtaposition of fantasy and reality, of where Fionn wants to be and where his life is at, sets up an interesting dynamic as the protagonist follows JFK across Ireland. The book presents an unyielding sense of optimism set against a darker more objective reality.The characters, texture, and pacing of the novel work together to create a rich medley of a story which is both easy to read, and enjoyable. Flemming is a natural writer, and her prose is lyrical and clear. I really enjoyed reading this story which no doubt comes from a very talented author.

You start the book off with a character who is returning to his childhood home after many long years. There&#8217;s a hint that something terrible happened to his family, and you&#8217;re given a glimpse of an older Fionn.That introductory chapter sucked me in, and I was delighted to turn the page and find myself faced with a much younger Fionn with a vastly differently outlook on life. Thus begins a story that spans more than three decades of time when all is fully told, but I do not dare share more than that and spoil what is to come for those who have not yet read this book.This read was a breath of fresh air for me, and the writing style and pacing of the story is spot on. Flemming&#8217;s prose is lyrical and her characters really came to life as I moved from page to page in the story.

I have been reading science fiction since the early 1960's. At the same time, I dislike both flowery writing, and horror.  IMHO, a story about a woman who is made from pastry and who is repeatedly eaten alive is horror.  And the writing...it was flowery, almost poetry..in other words, the writing got in the way of the story. There was one story that was almost passable, about a post apocalyptic world where mining ants had destroyed civilization...but when you thought about it, it didn't make sense.The ants were bred to seek metal, to somehow bite pieces of it off and to gather it around their nest. You could recover the metal by destroying the nest. Ants were specific to a particular metal, and they were fast - in one case a helicopter was destroyed in a few minutes, just by moving a half dozen or so ant nests into it.First off, there is no reason that mining ants would be eating raw metal, as depicted, they would eat ore, and somehow extract or excrete the metal. There is no evolutionary advantage to them eating the metal, so there is no reason they would breed true.  Thirdly, considering all they made of poison destroying the ecology and all that, I can't imagine that they could not protect themselves...I can think of several things that would reliably kill all of the ants in an area, or which could provide a barrier that ants couldn't cross.  Gamma ray radiation of the sort that is used to sterilize medical supplies, liquid nitrogen.  There are poisons that will kill everything in an area, and which will then dissipate.  Radioactive iron, for example, has a short half life - so seeing an area with some could kill all of the iron eating ants in that area, and after a couple days, people can come back. Or there could be a screw worm solution of some sort. This was a plague that was going to end ""civilization as we know it"" and it would have attracted a huge amount of effort - but all people did was to use more and more powerful poisons - such that they affected everything including things that should be more adaptive, such as intestinal bacteria, but not the ants.But that is OK. Science Fiction stories have had bad science in them for a very long time.  The problem was, almost exactly, the one in Mark Twain'sFenimore Cooper's Literary Offences, his criticism of the writing of James Fenimore cooper'sThe Last of the Mohicans. He talks about letting the writing get in the way of the story, of being too flowery, and of not using plain language...and that is what I see here...just too much (and too flowery) writing for the amount of story there.I still read the writers I loved as a child...Robert A. Heinlein, and Ben Bova, H. Beam Piper.  They used simple language to tell a story that was interesting - the ideas in the story were in the forefront.This is science fiction, and the ideas should be as important as the characters. In ""Between Planets"", Heinlein makes Venus one of the characters...too bad he got it all wrong, I would have loved to wash dishes on that Venus.Now in Clarkesworld, the editor has picked three stories, and they might have been written by the same person, and the writing was the main character.

The timing and benefits to Governor Romney are obvious.  This channel allows him to communicate his message quickly, outside of the adversarial, sound-bite constraints of debate, and free from the charge of, well... charging for it.  Nicely done.  There are advantages for prospective voters, too--including those certain they will not support Romney's candidacy.  He lays out a very specific plan.  Agree with him or not, readers must admit that this is more than a vague cry for some kind of unknown change.  It is clear where Romney stands and what he proposes to do.In an introductory letter, Romney outlines his approach.  ""I have formulated a comprehensive and integrated plan that focuses on seven areas where reform is urgently needed:  taxes, regulation, trade, energy, labor, human capital, and fiscal policy.""  He then tackles each area in turn, describing its impact on the economy, the negative effects of President Obama's policies, and the objectives of a Romney administration.  The book closes with an appendix containing fifty-nine policy proposals.  If Romney is elected, we can use this list of proposals as a scorecard to track his promises and his progress.A sample of briefly-stated policies from the appendix:- Repeal Obamacare.- Pursue new trade agreements with nations committed to free enterprise and open markets.- Open America's energy reserves for development.- Prohibit the use for political purposes of funds automatically deducted from worker paychecks.- Cap federal spending at 20 percent of GDP.The book also includes endorsements of Romney's plan.  The first is an overview of economic policy by R. Glenn Hubbard, Dean of the Columbia Business School.  There are more specifically-themed endorsements from conservative business and political figures.  They include Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems on Tax Policy, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman on Trade Policy, former Missouri Senator Jim Talent on Energy Policy, and eBay's Meg Whitman on Human Capital Policy.  The statements by these high-profile supporters appear at the end of chapters, set off clearly from Romney's own analysis and proposals.This book is highly recommended to readers who want to evaluate Mitt Romney's approach to jobs and the economy.

I heard about this book from an email from the campaign and downloaded to read it.  One thing i really love about having this on my Kindle is that it keeps this information close at hand and I can refer to it when having a knowledgeable discussion of the issues.  I also appreciate having a main source for mitt' plan instead of having to glean it from parts of many different speeches and documents and set forth in a very organized way which really helps when trying to find his plan on certain issues.  The fact that a candidate is willing to set it all down in one source and you not having to quote from one speech or another or having to put his plan together from many sources.Mitt's plan is not only concise and well thought out but is written in a way that makes it very easy to understand and not wrapped up in political rhetoric so you don't have to pull plan parts out from the politics of the day to discern exactly what he is saying.  And his plan makes sense and makes it easy to see how it can work without miracles instead of hard work.  He makes it very clear how something will take longer then others but what we can expect the results to be.  We aren't being handed a bunch of chants to repeat without being given a clue as to what they mean or how it will be brought about.This is a must read, especially if you have ever had a moment when you felt like shrugging and wondering if there is a way to get this country fixed and back on its feet here is your answer.  I could go into detail about the plan but its better that you read the details for yourself and not just take my review for it.  Even if you are currently willing to let the incumbent resume office in 2013 you need to take the time with this book and compare what you have heard for the past 3 years and what you have seen with what Mitt has to say about his plan for the future.  Not only do I agree that fence sitters will take a great deal away from this book but you won't be willing to just let the status quo continue and just re-elect the currant President.What this country needs and how to get there, how to return us to the strength this country had in past administrations is laid out for you page after page.  I actually found that the more I read the more I wanted to read and the more I learned.  It gives me a very clear view of how we got into the mess we are in now, one that many worry there is no solution to.  Mitt has a great grasp of how and what caused the predicament we are in now and one has to be clear about what wrong turns happened and how to go forward from here on the right track and what that will take.  Mitt is promising a logical step by step plan that will change things around with a sound timeline that with hard work makes sense for where this country can go.  Yes, we can do it and here is how.  And the how is the most important.  I don't think we can take another 4 years of any candidate becoming President with a great outlook that they want to achieve and promise they will but without a solid plan for the next step to take.This is a detailed plan and a very responsible one.  You may not agree with what bits and pieces you have heard up until now, from one speech or meeting here and there but this puts it altogether in one place for you.  It also gives you a good guide, once read, to evaluate and question what other candidates think about an issue and how they plan to handle it.  I found that every issue that mattered to me, and some I came to adopt as ones that should matter and I had neglected to think about, was laid out by Mitt, researched and discussed in a logical and informative way and followed by his plans to deal with the issues.",777,A16ETDSC1AYW4W,I am an independent reviewer too,6,5.0,762,45.96,57.80,38.78,63.09,36.29,12.60,91.99,61.42,16.27,7.48,2.49,1.05,2.23,1.05,0.66,8.79,6.43,15.75,9.06,7.74,9.19,1.84,17.19,4.07,1.84,3.67,1.57,2.23,3.41,2.49,0.52,0.13,0.00,0.13,7.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.05,14.96,3.94,3.28,1.44,2.10,1.84,4.20,3.02,0.79,1.31,0.66,0.39,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.53,1.44,2.76,1.97,2.62,0.13,3.28,11.42,3.41,11.15,2.10,5.91,3.54,4.33,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.13,0.00,5.77,3.28,1.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.79,0.00,0.00

After 25 straight months of private sector job growth under President Obama, Romney has to have a clear plan for me to vote for him.  As an ""Independent"", I wanted to see if I could find out what that plan was.  The only way I can describe what I read was, ""George Bush Version 2.0"".The book's summary says that, ""Mitt Romney seeks to reduce taxes, spending, regulation, and government programs."" This is very true ... Under the Republican's ""Paul Ryan Budget Plan"", which Romney endorced and the American Counsel of Bishops has denounced, stating it, ""fails to meet moral standards"" Mitt Romney would reduce taxes ... but only on those making $500,000 or more.  In fact people making $1 million a year would get a $260,000.00 reduction in taxes!  But there is NO tax cut for middle class Americans ... in fact, under Ryan's plan, (which Romney said he'd approve if President) people making $30,000 or LESS would see an INCREASE in taxes!!!Ok, so onto, ""Mitt Romney seeks to reduce spending"".  Yes, this is true, too.  Unfortunately, the reduction in spending includes the Education Department, (he told donors at a fundraiser event that he'd either, ""Consolidate the Education Dept with another Dept or make it a heck of a lot smaller.""  There would be HUGE cuts to federal Pell Grants for college students, and Paul Ryan's Budget also calls for a permanent increase to Federal Student Loans interest rates.  Personally, our Education Department is NOT something I would like to see fall under the ""reduce spending"" category.Ok, so we've dealt with taxing and spending ... now let's talk about ""less regulation"".  In definition Regulation = Rules.  Republicans don't like them, (well, to be fair, Corporations and Wall Street don't like them, and Republicans tend to represent those guys.)  This one should be obvious ... do you guys remember what happened last time Wall Street had no rules???  Regulations aren't automatically bad ... John McCain ran in favor of Cap and Trade when he ran for President in 2008!  Having no regulations is like having sports with no rules ... do you really think corporations are going to do, ""the right thing"" on their own??  We have government regulations to thank for companies no longer be permitted to dump toxic waste into our lakes and rivers, regulations to thank for child labor laws and government regulations to thank for minimum wage laws.  Businesses hate regulations because it is more expensive for them to dispose of toxic waste properly than it is to dump them into the nearest lake ... and it would be much better for their bottom line if they could offer desperate workers just $5 an hour rather than have to pay minimum wage.  Romney's business, Bane Capital, was all about increasing businesses bottom line ... so just be careful before you fall into the trap of deciding that ""all"" regulation is bad.Ok, so now we've addressed, ""less taxes, spending, and gov't regulation."" Let's move on to ""less government programs"".  The worst example on Romney plans to reduce gov't programs is Medicare.  His plan is laid out in the Romney/Ryan Budget, and it would CHANGE MEDICARE AS WE KNOW IT!!  It would no longer be a government guarenteed healthcare plan, but a ""voucher"" system ... where Romney would basically give seniors a ""coupon"" with a dollar amount that they can use on the ""free market"" to buy their own private insurance, (and if that ""coupon"" amount isn't enough, oh well, Grandma's just gonna have to pay the rest out of her own pocket.)  Romney and the Republicans want to ""privatize"" Medicare because it easier and cheaper for them ... even though it's clearly NOT in the best interest of our seniors.  In both the arguement of reducing gov't regulation, and in a reduction in gov't programs, I believe we need to demand that our lawmakes be EXTREMELY specific about what gov't regulations & programs they want to end, and who it will affect.Romney's book summary goes on to state that Romney would, ""Relinquishes power to the states instead of claiming to have the solution to every problem.""  If elected, and if the above actions did occur, things would go back to the states, but not for the altruistic reasons Romney seems to want us to believe.  Consider this:  If Romney cuts Federal Funding for Education, who do you think would have to make up for that budget gap?  The state and local gov't through tax increases, right?  So again Romney tries to sell us by saying he'll, ""Give states more power"" but fails to mention that this comes with the promise, ""I'll give states a greater financial burden"" as well.  Since only the rich will benefit from Romney's tax decreases, the middle class will still be paying the same amount of federal taxes they do now PLUS the additional taxes at the state and local levels to make up for all these, ""savings in spending"" Romneys doing in Washington.Romney's book summary ends with, ""Any American living through this economic crisis will immediately recognize the severity of the break that Mitt Romney proposes from our current course.""  I couldn't agree more!  We have a choice between Mitt Romney, who would TRIPLE the tax breaks for millionares and billionares than the Bush tax cut did, and go back to the ""deregulation"" days when corporations and Wall Street could do whatever they wanted, and hope they don't put us into a full depression next time they make their own rules and drive the economy off the cliff. Or we can stay with President Obama, who chose to save GM when Romney said to, ""Let it go bankrupt"" and who helped Americans struggling with foreclosers, when Romney said that we, ""shouldn't do anything"" to stop the housing market from hitting bottom.  Romney doesn't think like a simple, ""business man"" ... business men, (and women) care about their customers.  Romney thinks like a Venture Capitalist ... it's all about numbers, not people.  Let GM go bankrupt and the housing market crash - forget about all of the lives destroyed by those decisions.I was hoping to find some specifics in this book that would make me see Romney in a different light ... but the book struck me to be as phony as Romney's campaign has been so far.

Being an economist myself, I can spot a load of BULL when I read one and this document is 90% bull.I'll just take one area and point out where this guy is so very wrong. Energy Policy.Sticking to legacy energy resources will not help make America prosperous. All Romney can talk about is coal, oil, and natural gas...the three money makers of legacy energy production that very much want to remain the money men they are. Coal is a disaster no matter how you look at it and some good advice for coal workers would be to take federal job training money when its offered to you and get out of the industry because you are about to be put out of a job due to disruptive technologies producing energy so cheaply it will become uneconomical to mine coal for energy purposes.Let me explain to you why.The energy resources of tomorrow are thorium, fusion, solar, wave, wind, and geothermal. Fusion is probably a decade away while wave, solar, wind, and geothermal are building geometrically and will produce a great deal of America's energy within another decade at a cost ranging from 1/5 to 1/3 of to produce the same amount of energy by coal or nuclear. It is becoming increasingly apparent that nuclear is to dangerous for most areas of the world so it is a really good thing that we have thorium to move forward with as it is many times safer and produces 100 times the energy per kilogram compared to uranium. Our first thorium reactor should go online either in 2012 or 2013 and at the latest 2015. With thorium you have 0% chance of a meltdown and the half-life of the waste material is 250 years compared to the thousands of years with uranium.In a couple decades we can expect fusion reactors to replace virtually all legacy energy product. Fusion is not a pipe dream, we have a test reactor in California right now that has already completed a couple tests and the results were amazing to say the least. It is estimated that the entire country could be powered by 5-10 fusion plants running at full capacity so the era of low cost energy is nearly here.As for the rest of the book....well you research it yourself.

Aside from the enraged ideologues, we will also have Romney's political rivals who must somehow catch or derail this train that just left the station.As an ultra-conservative tea party RTKB type, I was more impressed with this book (that actually reads like a book) than I expected to be. It is full of ideas and tactics that you never hear discussed in typical bbq politico discourse. Anyone with a truly earned high school diploma can understand what is being explained in here. There is no reason to be intimidated by it. That being said, it has meat and potatoes for the thinkers, as well.I heard bells going off at certain ideas that I saw were attempting to get to the root of the problems and not merely treat the symptoms. This book serves oh so many purposes for the Romney campaign. I think it treats the people like adults, it offers something more than just campaign rhetoric and criticism (which are also plentiful), it gives you an idea of just how much Mitt had familiarized himself with the American economy and it's problems, and I think it shows that he actually cares about America and Americans (not just conservatives). It also shows that he is not an ideologue who is here to merely scream and shout for his team, but rather someone who fully understands and believes what he is saying, yet also recognizes the need to develop political will in the people. There is a lot of volatility in our society right now and a prettty disgruntled gov dependant class (IMHO). The last thing we really need is for a quarter or maybe half of our country to believe that a form of oppression is being implemented upon them by a greedy, evil (R). There may actually be a way out of this! This is about what will do the most for the most amount of people and what can actually be accomplished without needing to have the conversation about who deserves or does not deserve what. Many slam him for not ""coming out strong enough"" for so and so, or ""being a Rino"" for not condemning so and so. C'mon, playing that game only preaches to the choir. If he were running for the president of the RNC or Tea Party that would be fine, but he realizes he is running for the POTUS and, whether we like it or not, he will also represent the other half of the country who are not conservative. Being an ideologue makes good hay in the Primaries, but people stop hearing you when you say certain things (just like in religion). This is where Perry could learn a lesson. I actually agree with Perry, but he could get a lot more done by making a thoughtful case for why our ideas will work instead of saying key words to only rally the base. How many people are turned off when a professing Christian approaches you and asks you if you have a personal relationship with Christ(too)? As a Christian myself, I know it is not the best way to relate to a non-believer. To present any ""doctrine"" as a given without explanation or consideration for all of the people you are speaking to (Paul), all while divining the motives of whomever disagree (Obama) will make you less friends in politics or religion. If you have something important and controversial to say, don't just proclaim it settled (Gore), make your case, and if need be, agree to disagree! I suspect that when all the political dust settles, most conservatives, moderates, and maybe even liberals may find that they at least don't have as much reason to hate Romney as many do Obama and Bush. That sounds like a good way for a new President to actually get the ball rolling with political capital and avoid a civil war while he is at it...Here are a few noteworthy conservative ideas Romney lays out AND makes a good case for-Secret ballots and free choice for or against unions in all states.Income earned and taxed abroad is not taxed again here.Green card attached to every advanced technical degree given to foreign students.Getting CO2 (what we exhale) removed from the Clean Air Act.Make regulatory bodies have to maintain budget, any new policy created by a regulatory body that effects the economy by mor ethan $100 mil must be approved by Congress.Cut federal jobs by 10% through attrition, not firing, by reallocating 1 new hire to a more useful job for every two that leave or retire from the areas needing to be cut.I am anxious to get things fixed, too, but I also realize that it took a while to get so far off course, and this ship won't turn on a dime. I do believe most of the ideas in this book would go a long way toward getting us back on course to being the beacon of freedom and prosperity we once were. Americas enemies are chomping at the bit to hit us when we are down. Let's not give them the chance. The best defense is a good offense, no???For the ""real conservatives"" who constantly look for a few ""sound bites"" to further write him off as a RINO, you may well choke while trying to digest all the meat here. It also might be harder to talk with your mouth full, but I suspect that is by design. Also, [...] ought to clear up quite a few misconceptions.

From that I concluded that Romney is more of a tactician than a grand strategist. Romney doesn't seem to have any grand vision for ending the Great Recession. Of course nobody else does either! What Romney does bring to the table is an ability to improve things at the tactical level --- to make so many individual improvements to government processes that the cumulative effect in improving our economy becomes major.While Governor of Massachusetts, Romney seems to have improved enough aspects of state government to become very popular, despite his being much more conservative than most of the Massachusetts electorate.This book is a campaign manual for what Mitt would like to accomplish as President. There's nothing at all radical in Mitt's agenda. It's more of a tweaking of the methods of government than revolutionizing them. Mitt wants to tweak the tax code so as to reduce the corporate tax rate. He wants to rationalize the patchwork of government regulations that impose an unreasonable compliance burden on business, but he supports reasonable, clear, and understandable regulations. He's for more free trade with Latin America and less with China. He wants to repeal Obamacare, the national version of what he did for healthcare reform in Massachusetts, and let the states do their own thing individually. He wants to reform, but not eliminate Dodd-Frank regulations on banks. He wants to reform the legal system to prevent excess damage awards. And of course he wants to develop all economical forms of energy in the USA.IMO these are hundreds of small-potato ideas that probably don't excite many people when taken one-by-one. Nevertheless, small potatoes can be tasty. Put enough of them together and they become weighty. I prefer this kind of incremental plan to the grandiose trillion-dollar stimulus spending programs that don't seem to have accomplished much in the way of improving our economy.Anybody seriously seeking an in-depth understanding of Mitt Romney should read his autobiography NO APOLOGIES.

I can't think of any other campaign who has ever put out a plan this detailed this early in the process and made it available to this many people.  Certainly Obama hasn't put out anything this detailed.Because of that, I'm going to rate this 5 stars.  I really hope more candidates follow his example and we get a primary based on ideas instead of personal attacks.Now for the content:*Taxes*Mitt is definitely focused in the right direction on taxes, but I wish he'd go further and I think he easily could.  He supports cutting the corporate tax rate (currently the highest in the world) by 10%.  Good start, but that still leaves us with a fairly high rate compared to other OECD nations.  He supports ending the death tax, ending taxes on savings and investment for low and middle income individuals (thank you!), and switching to a territorial tax model instead of our worldwide tax system.  He says we need a lower, flatter, income tax structure, and that's great.  Unfortunately he doesn't really offer too many details on that.*Spending*Here I think Mitt needs to go a lot further than he has.  He offers a 5% across the board cut for non-defense discretionary spending, which is good but is really just a small percent of a tiny fraction of total spending.  He wants to raise the Social Security retirement age or modify the escalator to keep that system solvent.  He would cap and block grant Medicaid to the states.  Unfortunately he does not really address Medicare, which is by far the biggest driver of our debt going forward.  He also doesn't address any reforms in military spending.*Immigration*He's got a fairly immigrant-friendly immigration policy, which I like, but it only focuses on immigrants with skills or who graduate college.  Not bad, but immigrants in the US generally come in two flavors:  Very highly skilled, and very low skilled.  Both are complimentary to the existing US workforce (if they weren't, they wouldn't be here) but he only addresses half of them.In my opinion the rest is barely an improvement over Obama.  He's basically making the case that he'd do a better job than Obama, not saying he'd do a 180.  He'd spend government money on better energy sources, beat China around better, use government money to fund different or better education programs.  It's a lot of government solutions to problems that should be in the realm of the private sector.  He's probably right that he'd be a better manager than Obama, but I'd rather have someone that lets Americans manage their own lives instead of trying to do that from Washington DC.  That's what Republicans should stand for, and that's the kind of Republican I'm going to be voting for in the primary.Thanks again, Mitt and company, for putting this out there.

The basic thrust is to slow the big government express and cut the private sector a little slack.  Some highlights follow:TAXES (cut corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, preserve Bush tax cuts, overhaul tax system longer term); REGULATORY (repeal Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, force regulators to consider costs of complying with new regulations, require Congressional approval of major regulations); TRADE (negotiate more trade agreements, get tough with China); ENERGY (expedite development of untapped US oil and gas reserves, ban EPA regulation of carbon emissions); LABOR (reverse NLRB effort to favor union organization vs. impartially arbitrating labor/management disputes); HUMAN CAPITAL (rationalize federal training programs and block grant them to the states, encourage immigration of well educated people with valuable skills); FISCAL (cut spending and cap it at 20% of GDP, support a balanced budget amendment).Most of these ideas seem sensible to me, but the difficulties involved are understated in many cases and there is little discussion of how to overcome predictable objections.  For example:#Repealing Obama would take more than an executive order that support should be given to states that wanted to opt out, including offering an alternative program (none is satisfactorily described in the book) that would work better.#It is said the first step towards ""getting the federal debt under control"" will be ""admitting we have a problem and refusing to allow any more irresponsible borrowing.""  In, other words, ""just say no.""  Fine, but how would President Romney propose to get the members of Congress on board?No president could hope to implement more than a fraction of such an agenda, so it might have been better to focus on what Romney regards as the four or five top issues and go into more detail.The absence of an identified author results in off putting statements like ""Mitt Romney says"" this and ""Mitt Romney proposes"" that, which detract from the book's impact.,,An account attributed to Romney would have worked better, even if most readers suspected it was ghost written.In sum, ""Believe in America"" marks Romney as a competent manager versus an inspirational leader.

It also makes it, despite some more up-to-date information, the less interesting of the two. That it is less personal and biographical shouldn't come as a surprise, as it is, first of all, not written by Romney himself, and second, it is a pamphlet, a campaign manual, complemented by messages from Romney-supporters in business, industry, and government. For anyone interested in getting to know a little more about Romney the man, No Apology is the better choice.I praise the initiative of writing a pamphlet in which ideas are relevantly summarized. The way it is distributed for free, either as a PDF, or as an eBook for Kindle should be lauded. I'm not a great fan of the book's structure, however. It should work fine in theory (a chapter on tax policy, one on regulations, one on trade, etc., and chapters subdivided in Obama/Romney dichotomies), but in practice you keep reading about the same policies over and over.The pamphlet's main thrust, unsurprisingly, is that President Obama did about as much wrong as he could have and that a Mitt Romney as President would be about as antithetical to that as it can get. Whether that's really true I leave in the middle. For anyone hoping that this text would have anything to say on social issues, you will be left in the dark here--the title might have already given that away. Of course, the economy will, pace Santorum, be the most important subject of the 2012-elections.With an unprecedented downgrade by S&P;  ""almost 46 million Americans...living on food stamps;"" crippling unemployment ratings, and an average duration of unemployment that ""has risen from 24.1 weeks to 40.4,"" Romney is more or less rightfully positioned against a president who had garnered a mythical reputation. Romney, on the other hand, is constructed as someone who will be able to fix the economy. He contributed in upgrading the credit rating of his Massachusetts--although raising taxes in 2002, before Romney was elected, may have actually been one of the key reasons [...]. And the pamphlet reminds us that when Romney was elected Governor, ""the state economy was in distress and the budget was out of control."" What it doesn't tell us that three Republicans (1991-2003) were Romney's predecessors.Many of the ideas in the pamphlet disappointingly lack in content and scope. Romney likes to talk about ""streamlining"" and may think people credulously believe in that concept as to accept it. Yet, much remains unclear when he wants ""rules affecting coal power plants [to] be streamlined to achieve the necessary environmental protection while avoiding job-killing plant closures."" He wants to overhaul the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and others, which begs the question: how does he combine that with adhering to the idea of  ""preserv[ing] environmental gains."" In essence, how, and what, and when? When Romney discusses financial regulation reform he merely points at what's wrong with Dodd-Frank, then demands deregulation, while stating that the good concepts of Dodd-Frank ""must be translated into law in a way that creates a simple, predictable, and efficient regulatory system appropriate for our dynamic economy."" Again, how, and what, and when? Flexible regulation practices of some sorts are needed. However, when the pamphlet claims ""because foreign regulators are not likely to implement restrictions of their own, U.S. banks will be left at a competitive disadvantage"" it is flat wrong. Europe has stricter financial regulation laws that are supported by clear majorities.Now, what surprises me a little in a treatise about fixing the economy in such hard times is the amount of third rails, such as the military (or militarism as Paul would say), loopholes, and tax-increases. Why not have a sane discussion on rational cuts in defense spending. Why not have a sane discussion on the many loopholes corporations consistently find to pay hardly any taxes? Romney himself did a pretty good job on cleaning out some of these excessive loopholes during his time as Governor, now we don't hear anything of that in the Republican camp. (Actually, Gingrich in the September 12, 2011, debate when asked about these loopholes, flatly stated ""I'm cheerfully opposed to raising taxes"" as to `reassure' people he won't do anything about them). Has it come down to this? I agree with Romney that the tax code should be simplified, I agree that the death-tax is inane. What I do not agree on is that Republicans make people believe that an incredibly small tax raise on the very rich will be bad for the economy. They seem to have forgotten that the rate was at a one time high of over 90% from the mid 40s until the mid 60s. Even during most of Reagan's time, the rate was 50%. And yes, the poor are still waiting for the trickle-down effects from that era.The total lack of criticism of any of President Bush's policies is daunting as well. Not a word on him, yet instead the pamphlet cites an overly incorrect statistic on debt: ""It took 43 presidents 220 years [from 1789 through 2008] to accumulate $6.3 trillion of national debt."" I do not wish to understate in any sense the enormous deficit and debt increases during the Obama-era, yet before he took office, the debt was already almost $11 trillion.I'm also getting a little tired of that, by now, well-known and unproven narrative that someone from the private sector is instantly--as by magic--able to govern a country. Thus, the statement ""Mitt Romney spent most of his career working in private enterprise"" is a nice one, but it doesn't tell us anything. As if malpractice is non-existent in private enterprise; as if fraud is non-existent in private enterprise. If there's one thing we've learned from the crisis, it is that ""corporations are people"" indeed, but not in the beneficent sense Romney has it. Lest we forget, President Bush had ample experience in the private sector. And the pamphlet's statement, ""with little private-sector experience, President Obama turned to the only thing he really knew: government,"" is about as silly as claiming that Romney as President, would use his Urim and Thummim to designate what's best for the US.",1048,A2LKQE0KNVWJKF,A Disappointing Belief,3,2.0,1073,81.37,57.04,13.39,59.29,26.83,23.49,80.62,51.16,10.07,3.63,0.93,0.75,0.19,1.49,0.28,6.43,8.57,15.75,8.85,4.94,7.08,1.40,13.98,6.71,4.01,2.24,2.89,2.70,4.19,2.89,1.12,0.19,0.19,0.09,6.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.58,11.28,2.24,1.58,1.86,3.45,0.65,2.98,1.12,0.19,0.28,0.28,0.47,0.09,0.19,0.00,0.19,8.57,0.93,1.49,4.57,1.21,1.03,2.80,9.13,1.40,11.56,0.65,7.36,3.63,6.52,0.28,0.00,2.89,0.00,0.19,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.47,0.09,0.00,21.81,4.85,7.18,0.37,0.28,0.37,0.00,2.24,2.42,1.96,0.75,1.40

A quick breakdown shows a single 5-star, a single 3-star, and 37 one-star reviews. These 37 reviews are based off of a type of ""boycott"" of the magazine, based off of Ex-editor Jerry Tsai, who stated publicly that a particular firearm (HK MP71A) should not be available to civilians.Clearly, this is a violation of our second amendment right.The good news, is that as of Sept. 9, 2012, Jerry Tsai has resigned. The means that those 37 reviews stating that RECOIL magazine is ""anti-gun"" can be ignored. A stain on the canvas, maybe - but definitely not worth ruining the reputation of the entire magazine on one of the most popular websites in existence.Now to the serious review part:RECOIL magazine is not just a magazine for firearms. It also spotlights modern technology for hunting, sports, and survival. They've got fairly in-depth reviews of almost every featured product, including the negative parts of the product - glad to see a magazine isn't biased because of their sponsors, for once. They have a fairly decent mix of articles, with the primary focus obviously being firearms. They try to include knives, vehicles, flashlights, hatchets, and anything else you could need for any kind of survival situation. Physical copies include a mid-size paper target, and the cover of the actual magazine is a rough light-grain sandpaper-esque texture, which is kind of cool and interesting at first, until you pick it up the wrong way and grind your nails on it.Overall: Read it, and be sure to clip your nails.",271,AADVQSEEUOMYZ,UPDATE: Tsai resigned 9/9/13.

We all know that's technology no civvies should ever get to lay their hands on. This is a purpose-built weapon with no sporting applications to speak of. It is made to put down scumbags, and that's it. Mike Cabrera of Heckler & Koch Law Enforcement Sales and veteran law enforcement officer with SWAT unit experience points out that this is a gun that you do not want in the wrong, slimy hands. It comes with semi-automatic and full-auto firing modes only. Its overall size places it between a handgun and submachine gun. Its assault rifle capabilities and small size make this a serious weapon that should not be taken lightly.""Part of Mr. Tsai's statement is factually correct only in that civilians cannot own this weapon, or any automatic-fire weapon produced after 1986. The remainder of his statement is abhorrent. He implies that ""civilians"" are irresponsible at best, ""slimy"" criminals at worst, and that only government agencies are qualified to handle such weapons.I recently learned that the requirement for the Boy Scouts ""Rifle Shooting"" merit badge is more rigorous than the New York Police Department's requirements to be rifle-certified.My 3-star rating is temporary. I will be monitoring Recoil's response, and give a new rating once the dust settles.

Recoil is first and foremost a gun lifestyle magazine, aimed at the modern shooting enthusiast.* The opinions in the paragraph in question accurately reflected those of the manufacturer, and should have been reported as direct quotes. Recoil acknowledges the way the paragraph was written has caused unnecessary confusion.* J.T., a passionate gun enthusiast and the visionary behind Recoil magazine, will remain as editor of Recoil.We thank you for your support and understanding.Quite honestly, if you read the article, it was one paragraph that was actually quoted from the manufacturer and we did not state it that way. Recoil has 26,000 likes on face book and the magazine has only been out for three issues and issue number 4 is just hitting the streets. I honestly believe that this will not hurt the magazine.

My Kindle edition of the initial issue offered included 9 short stories, including a great Lawrence Block ""Keller"" story and a new English translation of a wonderful Japanese mystery set in the world of the Japanese police. There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".  That's something I never did with the print edition for some reason.  I guess just seeing one nicely presented page at a time on the Kindle versus seeing one big intimidating digest all at once makes all the difference for us readers who battle an occasional lazy streak.I'll likely check out one or two other Dell magazines offered on the Kindle.  It was a nice diversion from the regular reading of my Kindle novel and news blogs to enjoy a piece of short fiction every day or so (I made this first issue last about two weeks).  But, whatever other Dell titles I end up trying out, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine is likely to be the one ongoing, regular visitor to my Kindle each month.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation the functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.",300,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,Yet another reason I'm glad I bought a Kindle,9,4.277777777777778,299,96.55,39.44,43.82,80.36,37.38,19.73,81.61,42.81,7.69,3.34,3.01,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.35,10.70,14.72,3.68,3.34,5.02,0.67,8.03,6.02,1.67,0.67,4.01,3.01,5.02,4.01,1.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,3.68,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,10.70,0.33,1.34,0.00,5.35,1.67,3.01,1.00,1.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.67,5.02,0.33,2.01,2.34,1.34,0.00,2.68,3.68,0.67,13.71,0.33,7.36,6.35,5.02,3.01,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.04,3.68,4.35,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.33,1.34,1.34,1.34,0.33

In fact, often I'll read a book that's a great concept, but it will end up being unsatisfying in a way I can't quite put my finger on, then I find out it's co-authored and everything makes sense. (I'm looking at you I Am Number Four.)Co-authored books have a problem that can only be described as ""voice"". Two authors cannot write in exactly the same voice, it's what makes and author unique, their own distinctive nuances and wordchoice, their literary fingerprint. When authors get together to write what ends up happening is they write in sections and the story seems disjointed, or they write together and lose any remnant of voice entirely. Whatever Happened in Peru falls squarely into the latter category.Cassandra Clare quickly became my favourite author back around then time City of Glass was released. I love her world, but more importantly I also love her writing. I loved it precisely because she creates beautiful prose that will disappear as I get absorbed in the story, but somehow still manages to make an impression. What Really Happened in Peru is not beautiful prose. It's utilitarian. The story is fine, the dialogue, the characters, the plot, it is the writing that falls flat on its face, the execution. There's no flourish. But I can show you what I mean quicker than I can tell you. Here's the first paragraph:""Magnus awoke in his roadside inn just outside Lima, and once he had arrayed himself in an embroidered waistcoat, breeches, and shining buckled shoes, he went in search of breakfast. Instead he found his hostess, a plump woman whose long hair was covered with a black mantilla, in a deep, troubled conference with one of the serving girls about a recent arrival to the inn.""Utilitarian, like I said. A sequence of facts in this case that all set the scene (Magnus is staying at an Inn outside Lima, he's dressed in his usual flashy style, he went for breakfast. The hostess is a plump woman with long hair and a mantilla. She's talking to one of the girls about someone who just arrived.) There are no thoughts or insights here, no pretty writing, just repetition of the facts of the story. And it's the same problem with the whole book. The story is okay but the writing is dead.To contrast, here are the first two sentences of City of Lost Souls:""'How much longer will the verdict take, do you think?' Carly asked. She had no idea how long they'd been waiting, but it felt like ten hours.""That, my friends, makes me want to read more.",440,A2Z28H74T8JDWF,Obviously co-authored,2,2.0,450,62.61,58.78,50.74,63.69,19.57,20.67,85.11,51.11,14.67,9.11,4.00,0.00,0.89,3.11,1.11,5.56,8.44,11.56,8.67,5.11,5.78,1.78,18.44,4.22,2.89,2.22,2.00,1.56,4.22,3.11,1.11,0.00,0.00,0.44,10.44,0.00,0.22,2.00,2.00,11.78,2.67,1.78,0.67,2.00,2.22,3.33,3.56,1.78,0.89,0.67,2.22,1.11,0.00,0.00,0.44,4.67,1.33,1.11,0.67,0.89,0.89,3.78,11.11,1.33,14.89,2.00,8.67,4.89,3.56,1.56,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.44,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,19.78,6.00,6.89,0.44,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.67,1.33,3.33,0.89,0.00

Charon offers Franklin a less-than-tempting choice: turn against his girl friend and her friends, or die. But when Franklin realizes that the people in his life had already turned on him, the decision becomes easier.MUTINY is a novella that's apparently midway through author Artist Arthur's Mystyx paranormal series. I was surprised to realize it is from Harliquin's Kimani Tru line (as opposed to being self-published) because it has several structural problems: it could have used better copyediting, the ""voice"" is uneven, and the story changes from first to third person not only between characters, but within the main character, for no apparent reason.In the first part of the story, the main character has an enjoyably sarcastic voice, but it feels at odds with the setting he finds himself in. Then, he goes from being an apparently easy-going, laid-back guy to a power-hungry evil guy over a few emotionally unconvincing scenes. He also goes from seeming to be primarily physically interested in his girlfriend to being obsessed with her.Despite these problems, MUTINY is an interesting, fast-paced story... which leads to a few more issues: First, this reader had to struggle to figure out what was going on, only to be left hanging at the end, because the novella is not complete, but more like a teaser (apparently) for the next book.If you're already hooked on the series, then you might as well read MUTINY.

Individual essays are brief, provocative, and tightly written.  In just five minutes you are exposed to a point of view, perhaps opposite to your own, that must be taken seriously.  And the authors take you seriously, too, as the writing has an intellectual edge; not to worry there is plenty of schoolyard finger-pointing to keep you entertained.If you are looking for new perspectives and good fodder for conversation at cocktails, without wanting to labor through a long article, Opinionated will fit the bill nicely.

The ""World View"" columns tend to be liberal in view, giving the magazine a bit of a liberal bent. But that's not why I rated this magazine 2 stars.I rate it two stars because of its lazy organization. Reading the mag in article order results in a tiresome repetition of viewpoints. First, there's the Liberal opinions. Then the Conservative opinions. Then the International opinions. In each group of opinions there are usually two or three themes common to each philosophy. For instance, Education, The War on Terror, World Financial Institutions, Obama, Bush all had opposing viewpoints represented - but spread out throughout the magazine.Rather than feeling I'm first reading in one echo chamber and then moving to the next echo chamber, it would be far more interesting to read these articles by the theme of their content. I'd much rather read a collection of articles organized topically, forcing arguments against each other and truly engaging the reader.Frankly, the editorial layout of this mag is just plain lazy and completely uninteresting.The opinions are fine.

There are many great features that keep you on top of news and the latest controversies minute by minute as well as great analysis in the comments that contrasts what the rest of the blogosphere is saying. LGF has four great things going for it which make it a favorite site of journalists and bloggers everywhere.The first is the owner, Charles ""Icarus"" Johnson, who is a great journalist in his own right having broken many stories, scandals, and controversies over the past few years. He is unyielding in his hunt for facts and when the facts go against conventional wisdom he fearlessly bursts the bubble. No ox, left or right, is too sacred for him to gore. A few of his coups are the downfall of Dan Rather over the faked memo, the missile shots  ""fauxtoshopped"" recently by Iran, the many examples of leftist, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian media manipulation, his exposure of Discovery Institute's fraudulent political campaign to get intelligent design taught in science classes, and his thorough outing of the European Fascist right as well as their many connections to the Paleoconservative and Bircher wing of the right in the US.He is expert in analyzing politics and the middle east, and is particularly good at enumerating the extremists in all camps. His affinity for truth makes him one of the most trustworthy sources on the net, which is quickly losing credibility through incessant spamming of conspiracy theories, knee-jerk reactions, outrage of the day posts, and ""follow-their-favorite-pundit"" blogger clones.The second great thing is the community aka ""The Lizards"" who add comments to every post by the hundreds - they analyze, dig for further leads, and often turn over rocks you won't find in the mainstream press. Over the years the community has grown tremendously, but the people who stay long term tend to be good debaters, factual; and like the website proprietor, they are honest to a fault.They don't care about bruising tender net egos in their debates because the key thing that differentiates the lizards from other web communities is their allegiance to factual evidence. (some of the bad reviews here are from those crushed in the melee of factual debate who then moved on to start LGF stalker blogs - a phenomenon that speaks to the strengths of the lizard community.)Many experts in terrorism, journalism, science, philosophy, technology, and business are members, and when news breaks they are right on top of it. You will find that the Lizard's google-fu is exceptional; they will root out the pertinent sites and factual data within minutes of any major event. They also put forth good speculation and analysis from their own expertise, and get to the facts before many news agencies. There's a clear reason why most major news outlets tail the comments at Little Green Footballs during any major breaking event.As an example when the highway bridge fell over the Mississippi the lizards located several local sources liveblogging the event and linked them, and the community analyzed the photos, compared them to past photos, and predicted accurately the point where the bridge had failed and the order the spanfalls occurred in accurately within minutes of the failure. The only thing they missed was the gusset plate that later investigations found too thin.The third great thing is the spinoff link feature: in it you will find categorized breaking news, analysis, opinion, trends, and stories from all over the net and the world with many contrasting views. Since the links are also monitored, you will not find conspiracy sites, or agit-propaganda except the occasional filings under the moonbat and humor categories. The links are multiply categorized because the lizards have many different interests, from netfads, to multimedia, to news, to music, from art to culture to politics - you will find it all there. The best new articles of the net and the newsworld also float to the top from Lizards plussing news items up or down -these appear under the ""Top Links"" drop down. Many bloggers, left and right follow this feature religiously every morning to prep for their own blogging.The fourth great thing are the music posts - Charles Johnson is a highly accomplished Jazz guitarist with superb music taste, and he posts some really good music. In the comments for the music threads you will also find other lizard musicians posting their favorites as well.So whether you are a newshound, a blogger, a political junkie, a musician, or just interested in a great online community with it's eye on the future, Little Green Footballs is the best site for you.",785,A1D2Z1SVYCGMWE,Little Green Footballs: The Best Newsjunkie Haven Right or Left,10,5.0,795,93.88,73.95,33.03,76.84,44.17,23.77,80.50,47.04,8.55,4.78,0.00,0.13,1.13,1.51,2.01,3.77,11.19,14.09,5.28,3.40,6.42,0.50,9.43,6.29,3.02,1.64,1.01,3.27,5.28,4.03,1.26,0.13,0.25,0.63,7.67,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.51,10.44,3.14,1.64,0.13,2.01,2.39,1.89,2.52,1.13,1.13,0.13,0.63,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.13,8.43,1.01,1.64,4.53,2.26,0.75,1.51,6.79,1.38,14.97,1.64,9.43,3.90,3.14,2.64,0.00,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.50,0.13,0.13,0.00,0.38,0.00,13.84,3.40,6.42,0.13,0.25,0.00,0.00,1.38,1.26,0.75,0.25,0.00

There was no rancor in my attempted discussion, no rudeness, no non-topical commentary.  It would be an understatement to say that I was surprised, given the care in my attempt at a discussion with Mr. Johnson; I regret to say that I am not alone in finding myself banned for disagreeing with him.  His decision is particularly regrettable in that I was one of the few who had not taken sides in the ongoing and pointless conflict between Mr. Johnson and some other sites with parallel interests.Similarly, I can only assume that any paid membership to LGF can be deleted at the whim of Charles Johnson.  Unless you're in complete agreement with him, or sufficiently lucky to be overlooked (and some of the comments on the articles are shocking), you might well expect a rapid banning if you contradict him about anything.

Either you're going to hate it, or you'll enjoy it.  If you are new to the Kindle, a conservative republican, and are signing up for this because you want something to read; you'll be highly disappointed.  And that's where my own rating comes in of one star.While still classified as a conservative web blog on many sites, LGF is far from it.  Articles routine attack popular conservative pundits such as Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Michael Savage, Glenn Beck, and pretty much all the other big names out there.  The author of the entries is Charles Johnson and he's waged a personal crusade against creationist theory supporting politicians such as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.  Anti-tax tea parties are mocked, and anything considered a traditional conservative value is dismissed as a relic of the past.

Searching the internet, bebopping from one web locale to the next, there wasn't much chance LGF would've offered a return incentive for most casual surfers.With the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the downed United Airlines Flight 93, along with the noise of continued bombardment in Israel, Johnson patriotically realigned his blog posts. He began to cover the War on Terror, the invasion in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the left bent bias of the'mainstream' media.As the post 9-11 period began to heat up, as President Bush began his slow ratcheting up to war in Iraq, after invading Afghanistan with little controversy, a serious and often angry discussion, fueled naturally by the events in September 2001, simmered within the more conservative ranks.Leftists and many liberals blamed America, and conservatives blamed either Islam or radical Islamists. LGF provided an oasis, a watering hole where likeminded patriots could vent their frustration, share their concerns and read pertinent news stories the major outlets either ignore or relegated into the deep back pages.During the 2004 election, as smoldering media bias lent a hand to democratic candidate John Kerry, LGF made headlines by exposing Dan Rather's blatant gaffe regarding the fake Bush TANG memos. By simple, clear observation untainted by a deeply etched agenda to discredit George Bush, someone at LGF, probably after noticing the lack of a fixed-width font, typed up the memo in Word. Using the New Roman Times font or similar, and following the convention found in the Killian TANG document, grave doubt was cast on the paper's authenticity.This, I believe was LGF's peak in relevancy or, at the very least, its local maximum. Once a useful tool, the blog has eroded into a worn and monotonous rubber belt of boredom.With the reelection of George Bush, many conservatives like me hopefully expected four more years of fighting jihadists, a confrontation with Iran, the shuttering of more hate-spewing Muslim 'charity' organizations, and a large decline or pro-jihad America-based media.Sadly, little, if any, of these expectations came to pass and the War on Terror went from cradle to grave without much growth in between. Bush spent nearly four years self-portrayed as a lame duck president, squandering the chance to greatly enhance his legacy as defender of American values and as a reformer in the Muslim world. As such, currently the War on Terror is dead, an anachronism from a time in America when 9-11 mattered.And that's where LGF began to decline, as the blog had increasingly less to offer. Today, when it isn't covering Israel's endless war with suicide bombers, LGF focuses on creationism, a topic far better covered in a myriad of other locations. In short, LGF no longer offers a unique perspective on a situation that hardly exists: the war on terror has concluded, and LGF wastes post-space on an issue most educated people consider dead.furthermore, when Johnson isn't posting on creationism, or entertaining his narcissism to an audience of chirping crickets with technical posts that boast how he's improved LGF, he's offering various open threads.An open thread at LGF is little more than a multitude of knowledgeable but otherwise apparently vain and pretentious posters playing for hit points. Hit points are either negative or positive, and most posts that garner negative points are simply unpopular by not conforming to the lockstep mentality of the various cliques that serve as basis for conversation.Within the LGF nomenclature are a number of terms used to label dissenters. One of those terms is a 'Moby'. Often, especially in the past, dissenting posters were labeled a Moby for merely offering an opposing opinion and sticking to that opinion throughout what many of the other posters gleefully call a 'roast'. A roast is essentially the group slamming of a 'Moby' or 'troll', and again these labels are applied to anyone that disagrees, along with the associated down dings in hit points.To exacerbate the situation, Johnson bans anyone he or the group deems a 'troll'. If you're a KOS kiddy, you get kicked eventually, regardless of how well or polite you played the LGF game.Essentially, posting at LGF, like most places on the internet, is very similar to high school. There are popularity contests, cliques, insults, and audacious but otherwise empty verbal threats. The exception is that most of the posters are supposedly adults, and many of them are otherwise highly educated. Much of this activity is included by the conversation category of the aforementioned 'troll roast'. If you're expecting enlightened and mature discussion, you're better off watching 'All in the Family', if only to avoid the undercurrent of anti-Muslim bigotry.When you consider all the interpersonal unpleasantness and the undercurrent of dislike for Islam, which has waned considerably with the decline of the WoT, and the apparent and inescapable irrelevancy of LGF's dwindling contribution to anti-jihad discussion, LGF draws a near zero in usability.Charles Johnson's never-ending self-love and self-promotion doesn't assist the situation either. When he isn't sputtering to life about his mundane photos, or his uninteresting musical choices, he's drawing tears of boredom with tedious extolling of his AJAX and refactoring skills. I'm immediately reminded of Ayn Rand's cult of personality, wherein no member dared to question her leadership. Johnson's influence and importance is much-reduced from Rand's historical consideration, but you'd never know it from the way Johnson appropriates the past via common sense moments (Killian TANG documents) and his own undeserved sense of grandiosity.To Charles: We don't care about your musical taste, your bike or your average photos. We don't care about your technical skills. We don't care to kowtow to your popularity metrics or your thuggish bootlicking fans. We don't care about your pretentious and empty post-quotes or your silly war on creationism. Everything isn't about you. It's about America. Either return to some semblance of political and ideological use, or give up the ghost.I give LGF on star, for past merit and the hope it one day can provide more than a blog-based bumper sticker on how to wander away from purpose and alienate",1021,A1QBGMULNKER4S,"Once a relevant blog on Islamists, now a mouthpiece for incestuous boredom",12,1.0,1061,93.79,62.57,20.35,8.02,36.59,25.35,72.76,43.64,6.41,3.96,0.38,0.38,1.51,1.41,0.28,2.45,8.95,15.55,4.34,3.96,7.07,1.70,8.86,6.41,3.96,1.13,1.51,3.30,6.50,2.45,3.96,0.66,1.79,0.66,7.45,0.09,0.19,0.09,1.32,10.56,1.51,1.13,1.23,4.15,0.94,4.05,1.32,0.66,0.28,0.09,0.47,0.09,0.09,0.00,0.09,5.75,1.41,1.23,2.54,0.57,0.47,2.73,5.75,0.57,12.72,1.04,7.45,4.05,1.51,1.60,0.09,0.28,0.85,1.41,0.09,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.09,0.00,17.91,4.24,7.07,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.60,0.00,4.62,0.19,0.00

This means that line-of-sight is completely irrelevant! I even just confirmed it will work when I'm at the other side of my house, outside. No more pointing at the TV necessary.The two drawbacks of this are battery use (the remote takes two AAA, whereas a similar device like Apple TV's takes one watch-type battery, although those are expensive to replace), and if you have a universal remote it won't be able to control the Fire TV.The remote is well built with a good finish. I'd say it is a thin notch below Apple TV's in terms of build quality (the latter being created out of a single shaped piece, without seams).Buttons are well positioned and there are enough of them to give more options than with, say, Apple's, but not so many there is any real time spent learning the remote. If you're a true master of your TV you know the importance of being able to control the main functions without looking at the remote, and this fits the bill well.Finally, the circular directional button isn't *quite* as nice in feel as Apple's, but perfectly functional.Seriously, though, the radio transmitter in this is something I absolutely love.",221,AAV3HU72C3R3G,Top tier remote with exceptional range,6,5.0,229,75.33,36.33,58.38,90.56,38.17,17.47,84.28,53.28,10.48,4.80,2.18,0.00,2.18,0.00,0.44,5.68,9.61,14.41,8.73,6.99,6.11,2.62,15.72,5.24,3.49,0.44,1.75,3.06,4.80,4.37,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.28,1.75,2.18,0.87,3.06,3.06,6.11,4.37,1.31,1.75,1.31,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.55,0.44,2.62,2.18,1.75,0.00,1.75,11.35,0.87,13.10,1.31,9.61,2.62,0.87,3.49,0.44,1.31,0.00,0.00,1.75,0.00,0.00,0.44,1.31,0.00,21.40,4.37,6.55,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44,1.31,0.00,4.37,3.49,0.87

You get the subtle, sneaky humor, or you don't. For those that do, the issue at hand is whether the Kindle edition is worth the price.As a new Kindle user, one of the things I look for in a magazine is not just the quality of what's inside, but how well its put together and formatted and how much I'm paying vs what  get. Is it a hastily assembled afterthought with little real effort compared to the print or web version, or am I actually paying for something that sees fit to put a professional degree of effort into the product?In my opinion, The Onion does a decent job in taking its silliness quite seriously.*Formatting*One of the major complaints among ""serious"" newspapers catering to the Kindle crowd is that pictures, graphics, and sometimes even whole sections are missing and formatting is often underwhelming with little attention paid to making use of the Kindle's abilities. Not only does The Onion include pics, graphics, and satirical political cartoons to enrich the experience, it is easy to navigate. One cannot help but get the impression that the other guys just aren't trying.*Value*The current price ($2.50 a month, or about $0.63 an issue rounded up) isn't too bad for what you get. You get more sections and articles than most mainstream magazines and papers in that price range, with sections devoting to skewering everything including News, Sports, Opinion, Entertainment, and others.

It makes natural sense that an alkaline substance would be beneficial in removing acidic substances. I was in agreement with the author and was buying into the benefits of ionized water outlined by the author, but I did a little due diligence and tried to corroborate the author's claims. First and foremost I should note that my skepticism did start while reading this book - there's several sections that attempt to prove the author's claims with chemistry; these attempts came off as though they were deliberately meant to confuse the reader (I have a weak understanding of chemistry so I was able to follow along for the most part, but they lost me at times). After reading the book, I looked for the water ionizing product that is mentioned several times in this book - aquacure. When I found their website, I immediately recognized their home page copy - it was from this book! That was a big red flag for me, so I began to look to other sources of info on ionized water. I immediately found dozens of sites outlining ionized water as a hoax. One such site really spoke to me - it stated that the alkalinity of ionized water would be destroyed by your stomach acid, something the author stated as something that occurs to alkaline foods (I never put 2 and 2 together while reading)! It also stated that city water is frequently alkaline as alkaline water doesn't rust pipes. to me, this leads me to draw the conclusion that ionized water being extermely beneficial to health is bullocksMoral of the story, if you want advice on how to improve your healt, read ""how and when to be your own doctor"" - it holds MUCH more valid and meaningful advice than this book.",342,A1NLVLTB5VD0NF,nothing more than marketing aquacure,5,1.0,337,67.25,45.28,42.60,41.89,30.64,20.47,82.49,51.93,16.02,8.01,5.04,0.00,1.78,0.00,1.19,8.01,6.23,14.84,7.12,4.45,7.12,0.59,13.35,4.45,2.37,1.19,1.48,2.08,3.56,2.08,1.19,0.30,0.30,0.30,4.75,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.17,3.86,2.67,1.78,1.78,1.19,2.08,2.37,0.89,0.30,0.00,4.75,0.89,0.89,0.00,2.97,4.15,0.30,2.08,1.78,0.30,0.00,5.04,5.64,0.00,10.68,1.48,4.75,4.45,4.75,1.78,0.30,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.06,2.67,3.26,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.59,1.48,0.59,1.19,2.97,0.00

B005ZI2S84,Kindle Store,"[13, 13]",3.0,1.0,3.8,5.0,"Looking in the Kindle section for photo blogs and resources, a blast from the past popped into view:Shutterbug.  Hadn't picked up an issue of this magazine in a few years, yet there had been a time further back that I had been a subscriber to their print editions, so curiosity got the better of me.And more curious was the note that I found when I looked closer at the page: Available only on these devices.  A click there revealed that it was available for the Kindle Fire or Kindle for iPad, yet not for my Kindle 2.  But since it came with a 14-day free trial, decided to give it a shot.Opening it on theKindle Firewith its full-color display was interesting, as the only magazines and periodicals that I had viewed this way had been on the Kindle 2 or on friends' iPads.  And it's just like picking up any better-grade photo magazine off of a news stand... and then there are the ads. But there's a way around the ads, as I've noted in my update at the bottom.The content is good, and with some excellent articles.  The current issue that I looked at has articles such as ""Gimbal Heads: An Essential Long Lens Accessory,"" by Jay Miller.  The photos of the heads were truly state-of-the-art examples, and the author states: ""I've been a dedicated gimbal head user for a long time. If you shoot with seriously long lenses, no other head comes close to offering a gimbal's stability, articulation, and flexibility. Forget ball heads and anything else designed to attach long telephotos to a tripod. If you're a big lens user and you photograph things that move, a gimbal is the only way to go.""Travel photographer Maynard Switzer's graphic use of color and composition enables him to capture every nuance of the human spirit and its environment. His photo essay ""Capturing Character: Beyond the Beaten Path"" was a visual exploration but also a great article outlining the processes he takes to get the right image at the right time, even when one is working with limited time.The Image Tech pages reviewed theOlympus E-PL3(aka `PEN Lite') digital camera.  This has been positioned as a simplified, lower-cost alternative to the company's higher-end offerings.  It's now the entry-level model in the PEN lineup, sitting between the PEN Mini and Olympus' flagship E-P3, offering a combination of external control points and compact-camera-like handling that may appeal to those who want high image quality in a small package, and are ready to move beyond an 'auto everything' experience.  Shutterbug came up with some interesting pros and cons, as they did in the same issue with the newNikon 1 J1, with its new CSC format.There's an excellent article in the Techniques page, a book excerpt fromWes Kroninger's Lighting: Design Techniques for Digital Photographers, offering tips, lighting diagrams and descriptions accompanying the images of the models, and it's one worth reading.And of course there are the ads, the inevitable ads, and they do proliferate.  Yet in the Kindle Fire format one can just flip past them easily, or pause to read when an interesting one goes by.  At this point I'll give this a 4-star rating.  Its layout and editorial content are truly 5-star level, but without doing a page count, it appears that perhaps up to half of the content is advertising. (Note: please see my update below on this.)Had also looked at another old favorite,American Photo.  This one is also for the Kindle Fire or Kindle for iPad formats, but it's now a bi-monthly, and has a higher subscription price.  Perhaps later, but for now I'll get my issues at the news stand.The Kindle Fire edition of this magazine includes Page View, where your magazines look just like the printed edition with all the photos and formatting, and after seeing this issue, I can attest to that.  When I first found Shutterbug here, I had only been using my Kindle Fire for a few weeks, and while exploring this monthly magazine on this device I discovered what is probably apparent to many.  The heavy use of ads was a distraction, until I found the Menu icon on the bottom middle of the Kindle Fire's screen. By tapping on this icon, you'll see the choice between Page View (the default) and Text View. Tapping on Text View allowed me to read all of the articles without the proliferation of advertising... yet all of the photos are still there, and in glorious color when thy appear in the magazine that way.  It's as if an editor took scissors to the advertisements and just cut them all out, and the test is quite readable.I can easily say that this Kindle edition of Shutterbug is worth a 5-star recommendation... and I'm enjoying all of the editorials, photos and product reviews in a manner that I hadn't seen before.  A subscription to the Kindle Fire edition of Shutterbug comes with a two-week free trial, so you have a chance to review it and see.  Try it and you'll see what I mean.February 14, 2012",865,AEJAGHLC675A7,Updated: Shutterbug on the Kindle Fire,6,4.444444444444445,878,83.96,43.66,41.46,62.49,28.32,18.00,79.27,50.23,10.48,4.67,2.85,0.00,0.91,0.34,0.57,5.81,10.71,13.33,6.72,5.35,7.40,0.68,11.96,4.44,2.73,1.03,1.94,1.71,2.96,2.39,0.46,0.00,0.11,0.11,3.19,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.34,7.74,1.48,1.14,0.46,2.28,1.37,2.16,5.81,4.56,0.23,0.91,0.68,0.57,0.00,0.11,0.00,4.10,0.23,1.14,1.94,1.14,0.00,4.21,7.18,0.68,14.01,1.25,8.09,4.78,3.19,1.37,0.00,0.80,0.11,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.00,5.35,5.24,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.05,0.68,3.08,0.68,0.11

I haven't had a book keep me up past my bed time trying to read just a little bit more since High School (oh, so long ago).  This book puts the characters in some situations where it doesn't seem like there is a right answer and the lines between who's doing good and who's bad shift and blur like it must be in real life in areas ranging from the wild west, to Nazi Germany to rebellion and war zones today in the Middle East and Africa.Be aware, there is some language and scenes that are disturbing so not appropriate for all kids.  But a must read for those who are able to handle it.  A MUST READ.Also, I bought the trilogy and recommend that if you start you get all three.

It is meant for a light read that does not require a high level business knowledge. On the flip side, BW articles usually are lacking in technical depth and deep analysis. Its articles are rarely authoritative, but rather has a high quality newspaper(WSJ) type of journalism.One thing BW does very well is forecasting the future trends.

It is what it is, and I think we all pretty much know what it is, a well established franchise like McDonalds or Burger King, it tastes the same everywhere; and if you are happy with a convenient, portable electronic edition of Time magazine which can be read on the go, then you'll be happy with this.",167,AOQEOS16V8MEB,Kindle Time magazine is NOT the paper version,8,4.0,167,53.82,50.00,65.27,80.14,27.83,20.96,92.81,56.29,17.37,5.39,1.80,1.20,2.40,0.00,0.00,11.38,6.59,14.37,8.38,3.59,7.19,3.59,16.17,4.79,4.19,2.99,0.00,4.19,5.39,4.19,1.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.99,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,15.57,4.19,0.00,1.20,4.79,4.19,4.19,3.59,2.40,0.60,0.00,1.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.20,2.99,1.20,0.00,0.60,0.60,0.60,1.80,13.77,1.80,14.37,0.60,7.78,5.99,7.19,2.40,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.00,14.37,3.59,5.99,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.19,0.00,0.00

The writing remains diverse and interesting. I find that the lack of charts, ads, and huge picture spreads allows me to better focus on the writing, and the messages the authors wish to convey.However, it still lacks a table of contents.

B002ACP2BI,Kindle Store,"[12, 16]",3.0,0.5,5.0,5.0,"How and why the next Great Depression will engulf usWhy the US economy far more fragile and vulnerable than it was in 19291.  Our federal government, since the ""Reagan Revolution"" of 1981 (e.g. don't tax and spend, just borrow and spend), has borrowed during so-called good times, on a scale once reserved for a rare Keynesian stimulus to combat serious recession.  Thus we find ourselves at unprecedented levels of debt (comparable, in terms of GDP, to the entire cost of World War II), and so our current Depression has begun.2.  A corrupt-to-the-core corporate structure riddled with bogus accounting, reliance on financial trickery for profits and misdirected/worthless regulatory oversight.3.  A banking sector of such debauchery and fraud that the excesses of the 1920s are by comparison more like the pranks of slighty-naughty choirboys and girls.4.  A Federal system of entitlements (Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) which has grown far faster than the underlying economy for decades and now threatens the very solvency of the government itself, so stupendous are the future obligations.5.  A global military hegemony which costs more than all the other military's and intelligence operations of the entire world put together -- the US military consumes more oil than the nation of Sweden (9 million residents).6.  An industrial, transportation and energy infrastructure that, rather than being rebuilt during the past 26 years of debt-based ""prosperity,"" has crumbled in a long decline.  Rather than invest in electrical power grids and energy-efficient transport systems, the US squandered the trillions of borrowed dollars on toys, gewgaws, electronics made elsewhere, malls and commercial towers with only transient value and millions of bloated, inefficient poorly constructed homes no one needed or could afford, i.e. ""assets"" which were not productive at all, ""assets"" which are now capital traps on a scale heretofore unimaginable.7.  A paucity of US savings (and thus of domestic capital) with only one historical comparison: during the depths of the Great Depression when unemployment was 25%.8.  A huge reliance on financial leverage, debt, borrowing and trickery for corporate profits -- the US exports soybeans, increasingly worthless dollars and ""financial innovations"" that are now exploding in economies from Ireland to India with the destructive force of superweapons.  In exchange for this dubious paper, we have accepted actual tangible goods from the rest of the world.  And the rest of the world is now slowly waking up to the fact they've been conned on a scale few can yet grasp.9.  Globalization has reworked the global supply chain in an astonishingly brief period of time.  As a result, the arbitrage of currencies, wages, governance (less is more profitable) and environmental regulations (zero is the most profitable) have all placed advanced post-industrial economies like the US at great structural disadvantage.10.  The US claims to be competitive but much of this competitiveness is highly selective and thus illusory.  Everything in the U.S. -- labor, goods, buildings and taxes -- is high-cost, overregulated (except for finance, banking and governance) and vulnerable to unpredictable lawsuits and officially sanctioned looting.  Other than recent immigrants, non-US employers find the workforce is often surly, unappreciative, narcissistic, entitlement-obsessed, unhealthy, poorly educated, unmotivated, and more inclined to get-rich-quick schemes than actual enterprise or productivity.The middle management labors under impossible demands to enrich stockholders next quarter and heavy turnover insures few stay in any job long enough to learn it effectively.  Team cooperation is a doublespeak fraud imposed by ""facilitators,"" creating a phony work environment where employees and managers alike pretend to care.  This bogus environment breeds a looting, game-the-system mentality in which everyone is grabbing for all they can before retirement, restructuring, reassignment, resignation or getting fired.A ""quarterly-profits-are-God"" mentality reduces the workforce (even the good workers) to units of input which are pared back or hired without regard to morale or loyalty.  This managerial and cultural pathology makes a mockery of worker loyalty and breeds the very qualities of distrust and ""I got mine"" attitude which undermines both productivity and workplace happiness.11.  Last but certainly not least, the US economy is highly dependent on cheap, abundant fossil fuels -- the very fuels that are in the global depletion phase, happy stories about unlimited natural gas and tar sands notwithstanding.For all these reasons, we can anticipate that the Depression currently beginning to unfold will be deeper, longer and more destructive than the Great Depression of the 1930s.=====================Next, let's recount the chain of events that partly parallel those of the first Great Depression but are about to synergistically take their toll in even more destructive ways:1.  The postwar income convergence (i.e the rise of the great middle class, the reduction of poverty and the relative reduction of the Plutocracy's share of national income) reverses in the early 1970s as the ""true prosperity"" of the postwar era ends and is replaced by income flowing increasingly to the top, as stagflation, globalization and the decline of dollar gut the purchasing power of the middle class.2.  The rising productivity of the 50s and 60s slips into flatline throughout the 70s and early 80s, only picking up again as computer software and hardware revolutionize the back office, sales, manufacturing, just-in-time shipping/production, etc.3.  Concurrent with this gradual return to productivity in the mid-80s is the gradual rise of finance as the key profit-center of corporate America.  As income skews ever more heavily to the top 1-5%, capital/productive assets become ever more heavily concentrated in the hands of the financial Plutocracy.  The top 1% now owns some 2/3 of the nation's entire productive wealth.4.  As profits rise (from rising productivity), profits flow not to wages (which remain flat-to-down from 1975 to 2009 for all but the top-10% professional class), but rather they flow to that 1% who own the lion's share of the capital / productive assets.5.  As the middle class experiences a decline in their income and purchasing power (for reasons cited above, i.e. declining dollar, rising income disparity, and wages falling due to global wage arbitrage), they (the middle class) turn more and more to borrowing and ever greater debt, to `pay' for what they have been brainwashed to believe is ""the American dream"" of imported luxury goods, bloated homes, vacuous cruises, etc.The only other mechanism available to the middle class to increase household income, besides longer hours of work, is for Mom/Aunt/Grandmom to enter the workforce, which she does in the tens of millions, with sociological consequences that are still unfolding (i.e. ever higher rates of juvenile delinquency, drug abuse, homicide and suicide).6.  This advert/media-driven desire to borrow to fund the ""good life"" is hugely profitable to the money-center banks, which expand rapidly into mortgage securization, derivatives and consumer credit, to the point that they come to dominate corporate profits.7.  The financial Plutocracy, observing that actually producing goods is no longer very profitable unless you can fix prices, as per ADM (Archer Daniels Midlands), or gain government subsidies and tax giveaways (oil lease depreciation, etc.), sinks its capital into the FIRE economy (finance, insurance and real estate), eschewing real-world investments as comparatively unprofitable.(Though rarely noted, this is a longstanding trait of capitalism stretching back to 1400-era Venice:  When trade became less profitable than mainland farming, the Venetian Elite stopped funding trading and bought farms on the mainland.  As a side effect, Venice ceased to be a military and trading power.  But the Elite remained immensely wealthy.)8.  As the tech bubble expands, middle-class investors see the Plutocracy (those with enough capital to qualify as angel investors of vulture . . oops, I mean venture, capital) reaping huge gains, and they enter the dot-com stock bubble buildup with a vengeance.9.  In a happy accident, the Soviet Empire collapses just as productivity begins its computer-fueled rise in the US.  In a so-called Unipolar World, in which US military, political and financial influence is unrivaled, non-US investors seek the relative safety and high returns (based on appreciation of the dollar) of US financial instruments.10.  The dot-com bubble implodes in a speculative meltdown (dot-bomb), and retail investors (a.k.a. middle class 401K investors) are devastated.  The ephemeral wealth they once possessed, however briefly, fuels their speculative desire to get into the next get-rich-quick game, which just so happens to be ""something everyone understands:"" real estate and housing.11.  Having exhausted the dot-com play, Elite capital seeks a new high-profit home.  The miracles of derivatives (CDOs, credit default swaps, etc.) and securitized debt (mortgage tranches, etc.) open up vast new opportunities for leverage (investing using lots of other peoples money), off-balance sheet shenanigans, and outright fraud/debauchery of credit.  As chip wafer plants disappear from Silicon Valley (too dirty, too costly, etc.), they're replaced with paper, i.e. mortgage-backed securities that eventually prove to be near worthless.12.  Sniffing gold in them thar exurban hills, the under-capitalized and over-indebted US working class and middle class reach for the chalice of easy-money gold: leveraged real estate.13.  With the Federal financial regulatory agencies in a Republican/Democrat-enforced somnambulance, the coast is clear for brigands, shysters, fraudsters, con artists, liars, cheats, and assorted riff-raff in the realtor, mortgage and appraisal businesses, who all feed the ravenous maw of the money-center banks' apparently limitless appetite for real estate assets to securitize and leverage in exotic and highly profitable ways.14.  For a wonderful five years circa 2001-2006, ""the game"" is afoot, and no-down-payment Jill and $100-million-bonus Jack get immensely enriched.  Meanwhile, the underlying real economy is becoming ever more unbalanced and ever more fragile as real production and real productivity plummet, and everyone rushes to the speculative riches of exurban McMansions and malls.15.  This last best speculative leveraged bubble pops, gutting a Wall Street that had grown utterly dependent on ever greater degrees of leverage & debt, fraudulent accounting, and bubbles, for its rising profits.16.  Doubly devastated by the implosion of housing and their stock investments (mostly in retirement funds), the middle class faces the terrible consequences of its 26-year stupor regarding the ever-rising indebtedness that surrounds them and engulfs them.  Alas, the Emperor's new clothes are revealed as remarkably transparent.17.  Just as in the Great Depression, and to its great surprise, the Elite has also suffered catastrophic losses and declines in capital and income.18.  Having borrowed and squandered trillions of dollars since 1981 on unaffordable entitlements, military misadventures and assorted worthless bridges-to-nowhere pork spending, the Federal government (the Fed and the Treasury) finds that its ability to borrow its way out of its current debt hole is limited.  The rest of the world has finally caught on to the con, and Chinese university students openly mock Treasury Secretary Geithner's Orwellian claim that ""we support a strong dollar.""  The miracle is that he was not pelted with tomatoes for making such an absurd statement.19.  With the global media concentrated in a scant few corporate hands, this pulling away the curtain is purposely ignored by the media, in their ruthless campaign of pure ""green shoots"" propaganda.20.  As the wheels fall off the US economy and bubbles cannot be re-inflated, fruitless attempts at holding back the tide with incantations (stop, tide, I am Obama/Geithner/Bernanke!) and loopy claims (the market bottom is here, buy now! -- Green shoots are sprouting everywhere) abound.  Unresponsive to such propaganda, the real economy grinds down into a global Depression without foreseeable end.[...]",1914,A11PWZYS4XLNHC,One interpretation of the author's main points,7,5.0,1958,94.61,56.70,23.42,56.65,32.10,29.01,74.77,40.76,5.62,2.40,0.26,1.17,0.05,0.10,0.82,3.22,8.78,13.59,3.93,3.83,6.33,0.61,6.64,6.95,4.09,1.02,3.42,1.99,5.82,3.73,2.09,0.20,0.61,0.87,3.47,0.15,0.00,0.26,0.05,7.51,1.23,2.04,0.46,0.82,1.53,2.15,1.17,0.31,0.10,0.46,0.97,0.31,0.41,0.00,0.26,9.55,1.74,1.69,4.49,2.09,0.77,1.33,5.36,0.31,13.59,1.99,7.87,4.24,8.07,0.66,0.72,7.25,0.10,0.10,0.05,0.00,0.05,0.05,0.00,0.00,23.19,4.44,7.25,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.10,3.63,1.53,0.61,3.17,2.20

You can choose between page layout and text only, although I prefer the page layout as it looks just like the physical magazine.The Bad:My biggest issue with this eMagazine is that you're simply getting a digital copy without any extra content or interactive features, and yet you're paying almost double for a year's worth of the magazine (the physical magazine is roughly $19 per year and at $2.99 per month the kindle version comes out to almost $36 per year).The Bottom Line:If the price were at least close to being the same as a physical subscription I would give this 4 stars, but paying more money to simply have a digital version of a magazine doesn't seem worth while.UPDATE:  After checking out Wired Magazine's app, I have to say that this is the way Rolling Stone should approach the eMagazine version of their publication.  I agree with the other reviewers that it's annoying that you have to also have a print subscription (sort of defeating the purpose of the digital version), but the application itself and the layout of the Wired eMagazine is awesome.  Interactive content, videos, pages built for the Kindle Fire's screen size, etc.  So, if you're reading this Jann Wenner, make a Rolling Stone APP and model it after the Wired APP.",232,A13J2K3VLQ2CCF,I like it... but not enough to pay $36 a year for it.,13,3.0,233,83.49,41.52,21.71,41.28,46.60,18.88,80.26,49.79,10.73,5.15,2.58,0.00,2.15,0.00,0.43,5.58,11.59,12.02,7.73,3.86,7.30,0.86,11.16,9.01,4.29,0.00,2.15,2.15,3.43,2.15,1.29,0.00,0.43,0.00,4.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.87,1.29,0.86,2.15,3.43,0.00,5.15,2.15,1.29,0.43,0.43,1.29,0.00,1.29,0.00,0.00,4.72,0.86,0.86,1.29,1.72,0.43,0.43,8.58,0.00,9.44,1.72,3.86,3.86,2.15,3.43,0.00,2.58,0.00,0.00,2.15,0.00,1.29,0.86,0.00,0.00,16.31,3.43,4.72,1.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.43,1.72,1.29

I LOVE having it, just in case!This is a 'MUST BUY', MUCH NEEDED item when you purchase ANY KINDLE ITEM for those 'just in case' moments, as stated above, especially when there are kids in the house - of &#34;ANY&#34; age, especially teenagers! Why haven't they caught on yet 'to listening' by this age? UGH! LOL!The first time I purchased this item, I had purchased it for the Kindle 3G w/ WiFi Keyboard. I have about 3-1/2 months of this Protection Plan left on it yet. I have NOT had to use this so far, but I have the 'peace of mind', knowing if I 'do' need to use it, it IS THERE!This is how it works: You 'MUST' buy it when you purchase the Kindle item of your choice. There is NO GOING BACK TO PURCHASE IT! It is a 'now or never' product to purchase at the time of ANY Kindle product purchase.So I originally purchased this item the first time,- the 2nd Year Extended Warranty, at the time I purchased my first Kindle, as stated above, a little more than 1-1/2 years ago. So far I have NOT needed to use it. I am very careful' when I use my Kindle.This is how 'this' product works: The FIRST YEAR you own your Kindle (of ANY type) it is automatically covered by a 1 year warranty through Kindle. After that 1st year of automatic coverage, there is zero warranty left.Now is when 'this product' kicks in! This 2 Year Protection Plan covers the 2nd Year of owning your Kindle.(Not the 1st year.) This gives you an extended 1 FULL '2nd YEAR' of warranty time.You never know what 'could' happen, so by having this, even if it is only for peace-of-mind, you've got it! I look at it as a kind of insurance for the Kindle. I feel safe and secure knowing I have a second year of warranty time on my Kindle for the first 2 years of my ownership on ANY TYPE OF KINDLE ITEM in case anything happens to it along the way as I use it.I have just purchased the Kindle FIRE HD 8.9&#34;! I can't WAIT to get it!Yes, I purchased THIS PRODUCT WHEN I PURCHASED THE FIRE! Remember - this product MUST BE PURCHASED WHEN YOU PURCHASE 'ANY' KINDLE PRODUCT 'at the same time you purchase your Kindle (of any type)!' PLEASE remember this!You should be VERY happy with it!'The prices 'do' vary, depending on the type of Kindle item you purchase. This only makes sense, as the more expensive the Kindle, the more expensive the warranty will be. Regardless, the price of this Protection Plan has far exceeded my expectations!Additional thoughts: When we purchase ANY Kindle item, the costs add up for ALL the accessories we purchase for it, and it adds up  quickly! Not only are we purchasing the Kindle item, but ALL the other accessories that go with it, so if ANYTHING happens to your Kindle, you WANT IT REPLACED! This allows you to do so! So, to have this 2nd year Protection Plan is well-worth EVERY PENNY! It's a must-NEED item to go along with your Kindle!

The transition of Cassie was so spot-on, I was mesmerized.

It is the official newspaper of Nancy Pelosi, VP Biden, and many others who pretend to be ""Catholic"" lacking the integrity of Martin Luther who at least finally admitted he didn't believe as the Church believes and left. They seek to make God (and His Church) in their image instead of accepting that we are made in the image and likeness of GOD.

NCR will not admit that Pope Paul VI was a prophet when he wrote Humane Vitae. EVERYTHING he said that would follow from the contraceptive mentality came true. NCR and it's minions, having separated the unitive from the procreative (contraception) now aren't even sure what marriage is. Are you kidding me?Back in the day we learned that sin (yes ""disobedience"" and ""scandal"" such as NCR promotes are still sinful) has a bi-product in that it ""dulls the intellect and weakens the will"" or as an associate's teens responded upon learning this: ""Oh, you mean it makes you stupid and lazy"". And so we have ""card carrying Catholics"" who promote (and use) contraception and/or become politicians who do the same and/or vote for politicians who promote abortion at every opportunity (can you say President Obama?).

B0085MOTG6,Kindle Store,"[40, 40]",3.0,1.0,3.727272727272727,3.0,"I recently bought the Windows version of Scrivener in order to complete some writing projects and decided to learn as much as possible about the program.Scrivener itself was originally designed for Mac, so the Windows version is relatively new (Nov 2011) and a little underpowered in comparison, with some nice features like customised icons, comments, scrivener links to html (important to generate more fine-tuned table of contents for Kindle) and research word pop-ups NOT currently being present in the Windows version.It has to be said however that the ""main"" features are all intact, and the windows version is still great.I thought I would get this guide to go through it as it said it was specifically for the Windows version, and the others are all mainly about the Mac version which is more advanced and hence often not really applicable.The actual tutorial in the program itself is great, so go through that first.Bought this to add a real users persepctive to the whole thing.First a couple of negatives:1/ This is NOT 300 pages long. It is actually 98 pages if you convert it to PDF.Don't get me wrong, its a meaty enough book and has 33,460 words (I counted them up) and so ""value wise"" it's just fine; but its NOT 300 pages as decribed above, which indicates a mammoth text of maybe 100,000 words.I converted it to PDF (using Calibre), because whilst Kindle is great for reading fiction it sucks for ""How To"" computer books with lots of screenshots, and I wanted to read it on one screen while playing around with Scrivener on the other.On the kindle itself the screenshots are simply too small to be readable, so converting it to a format like PDF is essential in my honest opinion if you actually want to follow along.2/ The screenshots in the book could do with being higher quality. I found them quite blurry to look at even on the pdf. Some of them (especially near the beginning of the book) are also screenshots from the MAC version of Scrivener, and not the Windows version which is a bit confusing.The two are mainly the same but some of the icons and the format bar at the top are quite different.It is a windows version, so the screenshots should have all been from the windows version.(Though you cannot see them properly on the kindle anyway - Most of the book is text, so its not as big a deal as it might be)3/ The book sometimes talks about cool things you can do, but then fails to actually tell you how to do them! (Especially in the first quarter of the book)This is a bit frustrating. It gets the grey matter going and makes you think about alternatives to try out in the program, but isn't explicit enough about method.For example, early on he talks about setting writing targets and it sounds like a good method he uses, but there is no detail on what he actually does to make it happen.4/ This needs much better editing. Quite a few Mac only features have sneaked in to the text.For example, under ""Write in a distraction free environment"" he says:""This is a simple one. You can blank out the background and you can add your own picture,maybe a view of the sea or the mountains to pretend you are sitting in a cabin in the Rockies churning out your masterwork (or a random image if you are me).""You CAN do this in the MAC version. But you cannot do it (yet) in the Windows version.He also talks about ""Page View"" a few times, which again is only available in the Mac version.And I got all excited when I read:""To see where a project is saved, click on the .scriv icon next to the project name at the very top of the window and choose > Path""Because that would be a great tip....But again, not in WINDOWS! Quite frustrating!He also talks about exporting and importing to Final Draft... You guessed it. Not in Windows. (Though Version 1.1 purportedly has it, and that is due very soon, so you MAY be able to do it by the time you read this)Later on he talks about importing one Scrivener project into another, which I also believe is a Mac only feature.Together with errors that don't stack up to my experience.For example, he talks about how importing .rtf files will preserve the images (which woulkd be a useful alternative to .doc and .docx for example) but in my expoerience importing .rtf files in the windows version (no idea about the mac), always seems to strip out all the images :-(In the later Kindlegen section he talks about ""You need to have Kindlegen installed on your Mac in order to generate .mobi ebooks forAmazon."" - Er...this is the windows version... This needs several more read-through edits to correct silly stuff like this.And there are probably others that I simply don't know.The text needs to be checked much more carefully by the author in my opinion.5/ It ends very abruptly - One minute he's explaining someinthing, then you realize that was the last page!This book needs some kind of proper conclusion.It feels a bit like a ""Frankenstein"" version he cobbled together from the Mac version of his book.It needs more editing, more polish, more examples and a better conclusion.And here are some things I liked:1/ Offers some thoughts on workflow - This is more than just a Scrivener manual. There is some discussion of the authors writing workflow (though not enough)That is quite useful, especially if you are reasonably familiar with the program, and can ""fill in the blanks"" for yourself of how to achieve what he is talking about.If you are very new to Scrivener you will find the book confusing.If you are a bit of an old hand then you may well pick up some new thoughts on how to approach your job of writing.There were certainly moments here when my brain did fire off nuances of ways of doing things because of the text.But again, most of the time you actually have to figure out the ""How To"" yourself.This is more of an ""ideas manual"".You might get shown where the screen is, but not to much on actual day to day use patterns.2/ Gets more detailed after the first third of the book (which is a bit weak)He kind of gets into the flow more. There are more screenshots and how-tos.Again, the screenshots are utterly worthless on a kindle. You simply cannot see them. But if you convert them into a pdf using Calibre, then they do definitely help to get an idea of what he is talking about.3/ Good explanation of LevelsHe DOES explain the hierarchy rules (levels) quite well (they are used mainly for compile mode), but this needs expanding and integrating with better explanations in the compile section.More compile practical examples would have been welcome.ie THIS became THIS after compile etcA few more examples would trump all the explanations.4/ The writing style is good - He writes in a nice relaxed way, and so this is an easy enough read.Overall - An easy enough read. Worth the money. But the author could do with bringing out a new edition that ""tidies"" this up and addresses the weaknesses that it currently has.",1221,AVEVK9B9SK1XK,Needs more polish...,3,3.0,1273,70.69,50.31,28.09,63.00,60.62,18.62,84.29,55.38,12.10,5.97,1.49,0.00,2.51,1.26,0.71,6.13,9.03,14.38,8.48,7.15,6.99,1.57,14.69,5.81,3.30,1.65,2.28,4.08,3.46,2.67,0.71,0.16,0.24,0.16,6.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.26,15.55,2.44,1.73,1.81,4.08,1.34,5.58,1.81,1.02,0.39,0.31,0.39,0.16,0.08,0.00,0.16,4.48,0.31,1.10,1.73,1.89,0.24,1.41,11.15,0.94,11.08,0.63,6.28,4.01,3.38,1.26,1.10,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.47,0.08,0.00,0.08,0.24,0.08,16.34,5.50,3.30,0.39,0.08,0.00,0.31,0.86,2.04,0.47,2.59,0.79

(residual lent & poor screen clarity) They were drawn in by current and former sales slogans alleging ...easy to use cleaners/wipes, no streaks, etc... this became a regular topic of discussion from time to time among us. Some achieved success but costly. Unbiased, my family, friends and myself loves the easy of use, convinience on individual packets and most of all the clear results of the screen. They're great on the go, vacation and in the vehicle. Important: when it's warm in the location you keep the packets, like in a vehicle, when the thermometer rises, the moisture dissipates moderately inside the packets. No need to remove them daily. The only minimal concern is with the plastic carrying case; the opening & tab appears verly poorly designed. The sliding tab becomes detached usually during the first time the case is opened. Moreover, this detachment issue continues relentlessly every time I attempt to open or close the carrying case. My advice is to use your personal preferred case/sealable & reuse it,  I hope this has been beneficial.

If you want the most efficient Fortune magazine reading experience, then get the Kindle version. If you want the best overall magazine reading experience, the printed version may still have the edge as of today.The Kindle version has no pictures (as of 5/7/09) and no advertisements. There are only articles and opinions. I was shocked how skimpy Fortune magazine was in content as I was able to read EVERY article in less than 15 minutes, which is less than it takes me to read the daily Wall Street Journal (Kindle version). I usually take good 30 minutes to read the printed Fortune magazine.Reading Fortune from Kindle 2.0 is a different experience than reading from a printed version. The printed Fortune has glossy advertisements and pictures. The tactfile feeling of turning each page somehow makes reading the printed Fortune magazine a slightly more rewarding experience. The analogy is similar to getting news from television versus the radio. You may get the same exact news but the television news has visuals which speak a 1000 words that the radio can never duplicate.The speed of which I was able to finish the entire Fortune magazine in Kindle has made me realize exactly how much time I spend viewing a magazine's advertisements and pictures. Also, the ability to quickly peruse an entire magazine using your thumb still can't be duplicated by Kindle.But the Kindle has some inherent advantages over the printed version. Kindle version has a search feature based on keywords. Kindle will allow you to read just about everything much faster, including the Fortune magainze. Using the Table of Contents is far more efficient. A magazine subscription is delivered to you wirelessly usually 2-4 days before the magazine hits the print market. Finally, I can't imagine anything beating the Kindle's content delivery system using 3G wireless. The magazine downloads in less than a minute.Overall, I recommend the Kindle version of Fortune magazine. For better or worse, just don't expect it to be the same experience as reading the printed version.",359,A313H6238N589,What a big difference lack of pictures make,8,4.2,367,90.78,25.65,29.17,40.47,20.39,31.61,80.65,43.87,6.81,4.63,3.00,0.00,1.63,0.00,0.00,2.18,11.44,10.90,6.81,4.09,4.90,1.63,15.26,6.81,6.27,1.36,2.72,3.81,1.91,1.36,0.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.45,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.26,1.09,2.72,1.36,3.54,1.91,5.99,4.09,1.36,0.82,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.18,0.00,2.45,1.09,2.72,0.27,1.63,8.99,1.36,8.99,1.09,3.27,5.18,1.36,4.90,0.00,3.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.72,6.27,2.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,1.36,1.09,0.54

Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need.  As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A.  It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that.  Like 2 Amps.  The device will only drink as much as it needs.  A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap.  Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide.

But this little steampunk novella stands pretty well on its own -- it has a sensible butt-kicking heroine, a dash of classic horror, and some decent writing (albeit with some anachronisms).Only a few hours after being fired from her job (for punching a governess), Finley Jayne is offered a new position: companion to Lady Morton's teenage daughter Phoebe. The job seems too good to be true -- she gets a beautiful room, Phoebe's old clothes, and even is brought to balls and parties under the pretense of being a distant relation.However, she is uneasy about Phoebe's older fiancee, Lord Vincent. Not only is Lord Vincent creepy and twice her age, but he is also still obsessed with his dead wife, Cassandra... who looked exactly like Phoebe. Finley sets out to find out what devious plans he may have for Phoebe, and her greatest ally may be her secret, superhuman dark side.There is honestly not enough steampunk in the world, and ""The Strange Case of Finley Jayne"" is a decent example of the genre -- we've got clockwork automatons, steam carriages, robotic horses and a bit of ""Frankensteinian"" mad science. There are still some unanswered questions (Finley's dark side and superhuman strength), but presumably the full-length novel will explain that.Cross' prose is fairly good -- it's not exceptional, but it's solid enough, albeit with some comments that sound a little too modern (Finley refers to Lord Vincent's plans as ""icky""). And while the first couple chapters feel a little fluffy, the story tightens up and becomes much darker with the introduction of Lord Vincent, although the subplot about Phoebe's boyfriend seemed extraneous.And Finley is a very, very likable heroine -- she's strong, self-reliant, sensible and intelligent. She also has a Hyde side (see, I can reference 19th-century horror too!), which allows her incredible strength and almost gleeful aggression that she has to keep bottled up. And I can't help but hope that we'll see more of Lady Morton, a clever noblewoman who recognizes a good bodyguard for her daughter when she sees one.""The Strange Case of Finley Jayne"" is a solid introduction to the world of Kady Cross' Victorian steampunk/urban-fantasy series, and leaves me anticipating whatever comes next for Finley Jayne.",396,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,What is Finley Jayne?,4,4.0,403,75.33,73.24,8.87,76.27,40.30,23.08,77.67,44.42,8.68,5.21,0.74,0.50,0.25,3.72,0.00,3.47,8.19,10.17,7.69,5.21,6.70,0.99,11.91,5.71,1.74,1.49,0.74,2.48,7.69,5.21,2.48,0.99,0.50,0.00,10.17,0.99,0.99,5.21,0.99,9.68,3.47,0.25,0.25,3.72,0.50,2.73,2.48,1.99,0.25,0.25,0.74,0.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.44,2.48,0.99,4.22,1.49,0.00,1.24,8.93,1.99,9.93,0.74,5.46,3.72,1.49,0.99,0.25,0.00,0.99,0.25,0.50,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.25,0.00,25.06,4.47,6.70,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.25,3.72,2.98,3.97,2.48,0.25

(about 9 short chapters), just pretty much a teaser, BUT VERY good! In order to understand the last book in this series ""Beautiful -Chaos"" you should read this novella first.The story is now shifting to Link (aka: Linkubus) who has been turned into a hybrid sucubuss and no one really knows what powers hes capable of. However, Link doesnt seem concerned with being a strange creature he is too busy enjoying all the girls (Savanna Snow included) drooling over his new muscular chest & physical changes. The changes dont stop with Link they also show Ridleys change from a dark caster to a mere mortal! Our Ridley is not taking to human life well so she has some tricks up her sleeve to get some of her powers back and get in a whole heep of troubble along the way!  Also, last but not least our lovable uncle Macon!!! He's being really quite about what type of creature he has now become after his return from the dead and quite frankly I dont think he even knows.He starts to take Link under his wing and sends him on some pretty scarey tasks to test his abilities & see if he is up to saving the world. You'll get some Lena and Ethan too; they are finally back together and Ethan is happily sad as the end of days approach Gatlin and the eighteenth moon is growing closer.

I had heard that chess was originated in ancient India, and that it was first mentioned, and perhaps even had it's origin (although that's very odd for a book or story to start a game, so I think I must have misunderstood) in the story. So that was my particular reason for reading this. As with chess, I quickly became both fascinated and overwhelmed by the level of complexity. There are stories within stories within stories. It is difficult to keep track of who is who and what is happening, although certainly not impossible, because it is not an incoherent story, just very complicated. It is of course abridged. I cannot imagine reading the unabridged version, although many do. It is a sacred Hindu text, so many religious and historical scholars study it in depth. But it can be read from a child's point of view as well, without analyzing everything, but just accepting the stories of the brothers and cousins who fought over a piece of land and all the animals who change back and forth from one form to another, interacting with the characters. In fact, I think that might be the best way to read this. Just let go of understanding any metaphorical implications and enjoy the stories. I also recommend letting go of the goal of understanding the story if you want to enjoy it. Just relax and float down the river with the stories that in some ways remind me of the Just So stories by Rudyard Kipling.

The magazine itself is pretty good and I really don't have any complaints.  My problem is with the publisher's restriction on their Kindle version.  First off for a publisher that focuses on hobby oriented magazines like FineScale Modeler and Model Railroader they treat Kindle readers like criminals.  You can only read this magazine on your Kindle.  You cannot read it on any other device.  No PC, No Android Phone, No iPad.  It is also only set to keep the last 7 issues of the magazine.  What modeler in their right mind throws out their reference magazines?  Plus since Klambach puts a DRM on their Kindle file you can't convert it to a PDF or another file format and archive them on your PC.  Here is the real deal killer for me.  They charge you monthly for the subscription and only put out 10 issues.  So those two months you don't get an issue you are still paying.  The yearly price ends up being almost as much as a print subscription.  How does that work?  I can see their pricing for the print issues since they print their magazine on really high quality paper and have really high quality images, but they are not printing anything for a digital version.In the end don't bother with buying Klambach Publishing Kindle magazines until they wake up and understand what the digital copy is all about.  Personally I am completely done with all Klambach magazines which is a shame because magazines like FineScale Modeler and Model Railroader are such quality magazines.

We have a magazine that is published only ten times a year, with some nice photographs and OK reviews and articles; however, I don't know what the editorial staff does with their time (I hope they are paid part-time and have other jobs) since the reviews, articles, and galleries are provided by others than the editors; and the photographers don't seem to be able to take interior views, while the editors seem to use photos and graphics so they don't have to provide more content. All the while, more and more modelers may be taking advantage of the many Internet websites that provide reviews, articles, new product and aftermarket exposure, galleries, tips, techniques, and forums -- all for free. I say all this because you would think the publisher and editors would attempt to engender some loyalty in the readers who pay to subscribe to the magazine with its faults, and with no discount for renewing, by making this digital edition free for them, or at least for a discounted amount. Also, on renewal, subscribers could be given a choice of format for one price, with both formats for slightly more. This may help keep subscribers, and recruit new ones, who otherwise would turn to the Internet for the same, or better, content for free. At this point, however, besides charging the subscribers an extra $39.95 for the reader version, as pointed out before, the reader version doesn't even have the same qualities of the print version.

It has everything: a damsel in distress, a handsome adventurer, a clever villain, narrow escapes, disguises and a thrilling ending.  I enjoyed the male point of view of the story.At the beginning of the story, Noel Stanton, our young adventurer, meets up with a friend from America.  The friend invites Noel to the theater and at the show Noel sees a beautiful young lady, Karine Cunningham.  With Karine are her aunt and uncle and a gentleman that seems very interested in being Karine's fiance.  But Noel feels like he's met the potential fiance before.  And Noel doesn't like him one bit!The lock in the title of the story refers to the Mapledurham Lock on the River Thames.  In the book it is called the Purley Lock.  According to Wikipedia, ""Despite its name, the lock is located in the Berkshire village and civil parish of Purley-On-Thames on the south bank of the river, rather than in the Oxfordshire village of Mapledurham on the other side of the river.""There are a couple minor formatting issues.  The page numbers show up in the middle of sentences.  And for some italicized words, there are strange marking within the word; like a double dotted 'i', and upside down '?', and a '1/2'.

Just a side by side comparison will tell you that the kindle screen is smaller than an actual magazine, so something has to give.  You can't expect to get full page view the size of a regular magazine on a screen that is smaller.Having said that, the magazine is beautiful on the Kindle Fire.  I love the color, the pictures, and the text is very clear.  Reading the magazine on the Kindle is a no hassle and no-brainer, even for my old eyes.  I have no trouble reading the recipes.  In fact, double tapping on the screen puts the text approximately the same size as it is in a hard copy--and I don't have multiple issues cluttering up my house, either.This magazine is full of great articles and healthy recipes that are great tasting as well.  If you are health conscious or just getting into a more healthy lifestyle, then you should check out this magazine.  Each recipe comes with a complete nutritional analysis (which I like) and most have full color pictures.  We are on a restricted sodium diet, and I just make necessary changes to lower our sodium content, but that's not necessary in many of the recipes.  Another thing I like about the recipes is that most use all natural ingredients that can be found in most stores.

At $6.99/month, the Kindle edition clocks in at less than $84 for a full year. With just a few days left on my paper edition, I decided to sign up for the 14-day free trial to compare them side by side. They are not the same. I compared the 12/27/2011 edition. Several of the small articles in the City region page were skipped. Some photos were skipped. There are no classifieds, no obituaries, and no comics. Without these three, it's just the TV news in print with no video. The lack of these three items alone is enough to keep me from continuing the Kindle Edition. If I continued it, I would always be wondering if I was getting all of the news. I see no reason classifieds, obits and comics couldn't be included. Obits are just text and a few headshots. The comics are small in the print edition anyway, and they're black and white except for weekends. And to not include ""Real Life Adventures"", the best comic on the planet, is just a travesty.

Now that they both have reach their breaking point, they each separately goes online to find what they're looking for.THOUGHTSThis was a likeable story. I thought the first half of the story was cute, but it kept the same pace that made you eager for something to happen, which is understandable as the author is building up to the plot and climax of the story. However, I found the first half just ok. The second half became exciting, sexy and steamy.

B007MT0Z34,Kindle Store,"[11, 11]",3.0,1.0,3.875,5.0,"It's good to find such full-fledged magazines likeDigital Photobeing made available for the Kindle Fire. A short time back, they were hard to find, and the ones that were substandard in quality and annoying in their formatting, but this one, which started online here in April 2012, makes good use of the Kindle Fire technology, and it can be fully downloaded so you can read it even when you're not wirelessly connected.There are very poignant articles to be found in this bi-monthly digital publication. In the current issue that I'm looking at right now, there are articles such as ""What Defines A Pro DSLR?"" by Mike Stensvold, in which he outlines some of the main ways in which today's pro cameras differ from enthusiast models, covering things like sensor size, durability, batteries (and power tips), the differences between processors, metering and such. It's a well detailed article with excellent color photos and diagarms, and one that answers the question as to whether or not a pro-level DSLR is worthy of consideration.There's an excellent article about must-have optical filters for your camera, noting that even the best software can't replace them. the article is an excellent primer for those getting started, and offering a solid general suggestion to invest in quality glass, noting that your lens is only as good as its most inferior element: if you use a cheap filter, you're compromising the quality of your entire optical system.You'll find equipment sections along with product reviews, and the columns that we're used to in the printed-paper editions are here, along with the editorials. There are features and helpful how-to articles throughout.It should be noted that this digital publication is not set up for the legacy Kindle devices; as noted in the little drop-down on the product page, this one is only available for the Kindle Fire and the Kindle for iPad (Version 2.9 or later) as of this date. This one is done by the same group that publishesOutdoor Photographerfor the Kindle Fire, for those who are interested in another noteworthy photo magazine, as it's proven to be a good one.One thing worthy of note: if you find the heavy use of ads to be a distraction, look for the Menu icon on the bottom middle of the Kindle Fire's screen. By tapping on this icon, you'll see the choice between Page View (the default) and Text View. Tapping on Text View allows you to read all of the articles without the proliferation of advertising... yet all of the photos are still there, and in glorious color when they appear in the magazine that way. Just imagine if you had an editorial assistant who took scissors to the advertisements and just cut them all out, leaving you with all of the text and images.If you're into digital photography, this Kindle Fire edition ofDigital Photois easily worth a 5-star recommendation, and this is one with which you can enjoy all of the photos, editorials, how-to articles and product reviews the way you like. Granted, this magazine can be accessed online, and they even have a Facebook page, but there are the times that I'm traveling or even kicking back at night, reading, and having access to this excellent photo publication. And don't forget that a subscription to the Kindle Fire edition of Digital Photo comes with a two week free trial, so you have a chance to review it and see. Try it and you'll see what I mean.8/3/2012",578,AEJAGHLC675A7,Digital Photo Magazine: the Kindle Fire Edition,7,4.444444444444445,596,74.20,68.06,14.93,72.85,39.73,20.97,80.54,52.68,12.25,4.87,0.50,0.17,3.02,0.17,1.01,7.38,8.72,14.26,7.89,5.70,7.55,1.01,12.92,4.70,2.52,2.18,2.35,1.68,3.69,3.02,0.50,0.00,0.17,0.17,6.04,0.00,0.17,0.00,0.17,9.56,2.35,2.01,1.01,2.18,1.34,3.02,4.87,3.52,0.00,1.34,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,4.70,0.84,1.01,1.51,1.68,0.00,1.68,10.23,0.50,10.07,0.84,6.38,3.19,4.03,1.01,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,16.44,3.52,6.21,0.34,0.17,0.17,0.00,1.51,0.34,2.85,1.01,0.34

Thus, when this one came out, after a very long wait, I was ecstatic. But two years has made a big difference in how I see books. It seemed to me as if the author thought that Alera was a strong heroine, but she was the biggest wimp ever. Yes, she sometimes did brave things but immediately after she would burst into tears and be consoled by the men around her. She is not a good role model, even though I think the author wanted her to be independent from her husband. But while she was independent from him, she completely relied on other men, like the of the  ""hero"" of this story, and her countless bodyguards. Then on top of that, her sister is the most unidimensional sad-sack in the history of ever. There is not one truly strong woman in this book, unless you count the queen of the rival country. Spoiler Alert: She ends up with the ""hero"" even though, he helped to take her country away from her. I mean, WHAT IS THAT? WHAT KIND OF QUEEN ARE YOU? I get that you cannot chose who you love, but as queen you better sacrifice that love for your country. She should of killed him, not melted into his arms in the end, completely satisfied that this man had taken away her country, and helped kill her subjects. Some may raise the point that he was very noble and did not want to do it, but the fact is that he still did, and that she ends up with him sickens me. I spent the first half annoyed with Alera for being so weak, I wanted her to grow some woman balls. She never really stood up to Steldor, she just found ways to make him angry with her. And although, Scarlett O'Hara is a controversial heroine, Alera should of taken a couple cues from her to do what she could have to save her country. She was completely fine with not even knowing anything about the war, and letting her husband, whom she despises for no good reason deal with it, until it is at her front door. Alera is no queen and that she lost the war and did not even really put up a fight, which Scarlett O'Hara did to save her home, really showed that she no more than steldor was ever fit to rule a country. I spent the second part of this book cussing at it for wasting my time. If I could change the ending of this book, it would be with Alera leading a rebel army against the enemy, with Steldor as her military leader. Do not get me wrong, their marriage would still have broken up, but she would be fighting for her country even if it meant that she was fighting against the man that she loved.",494,A82BX58ZD096N,Crap,1,1.0,495,37.26,72.77,6.95,25.77,21.52,10.91,92.12,63.03,20.81,13.54,3.03,0.00,1.21,9.09,0.20,7.27,6.26,14.34,9.09,6.67,6.67,2.42,15.56,4.44,2.63,1.82,1.62,1.41,7.68,3.84,3.84,0.00,2.42,0.61,16.36,0.81,0.00,9.29,2.83,14.95,1.82,1.82,2.83,2.22,1.82,6.06,0.40,0.40,0.00,0.00,1.21,0.40,0.20,0.00,0.00,8.69,1.41,2.22,4.85,1.62,0.20,6.26,6.46,0.40,13.13,1.01,7.07,5.05,1.62,1.01,0.40,0.40,0.20,0.81,0.61,0.00,0.40,0.20,0.00,0.00,12.73,4.24,6.46,0.20,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.20,0.81,0.40,0.00,0.00

Being afraid to be a burden on others, having to spend hundreds of dollars on medications, feeling too bad to attend family or religious functions, losing job or having to downsize to a much lower-paying job - all of these can make the sick person feel depressed and worthless.The Devotions at Rest Ministries are based on Scripture and intended to make chronically ill persons believe in themselves again. They tell a story of how human frailty can be used by God to become spiritual strength. Hope, encouragement, and a realization of blessings owned combine to give the ill person just what he or she needs to make it through the challenges of that day. These devotions are truly the best for the blest!",176,A2548YITVXXERF,Devotions for the Chronically Ill - The Best for the Blest,11,5.0,176,93.88,65.47,19.82,68.66,25.14,22.73,90.91,49.43,7.95,3.98,0.57,0.00,0.00,1.14,2.27,3.98,9.66,15.91,7.95,2.84,5.11,0.57,15.91,3.98,1.14,1.14,0.57,2.84,11.36,6.82,4.55,0.57,0.00,2.27,9.66,0.57,0.00,0.57,0.57,16.48,3.41,4.55,1.14,5.11,1.14,4.55,2.27,0.00,0.00,2.27,5.68,0.00,5.68,0.00,0.00,6.82,1.70,1.70,3.41,0.57,1.14,0.57,12.50,1.70,9.66,0.57,6.25,2.84,2.84,0.57,0.57,1.70,3.98,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.23,3.98,3.98,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.57,1.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00

Only the busiest tables/graphs are illegible.  Fortunately, such tables/graphs are relatively infrequent and I enjoyed reading the latest NEJM on the Kindle DX, and most physicians have other ways to obtain these table/graphs if they need them.  Yet, Amazon needs to find a way to overcome this problem if they are truly going to cater to the academic audience as they report that they are trying to do.  Many textbooks have busy tables/graphs, and it may be difficult for faculty and students to get the hardcopy version of those tables.One solution would be to have higher resolution versions of all Kindle purchases/subscriptions available on line to be accessed from a PC/MAC.I cancelled my trial for the same reason I cancelled my print subscription a few years ago.  I only did the trial to answer one of the earlier reviews questions regarding appearance on the DX.  I am a pediatric endocrinologist, and most NEJM articles are too irrelevant to my field for me to regularly read the entire journal.  For me, the NEJM free table of contents delivery to my e-mail that includes abstracts is sufficient for my purposes.  Being in academic medicine, it is not difficult for me to obtain any full article on line when I need it.  However, if I was in a more general specialty, or almost any internal medicine specialty, I would not have hesitated to subscribe to the Kindle version of the NEJM.  I hope Amazon makes JCEM available.One final comment.  I do not understand why the Kindle versions of most newspapers, magazines and journals are as, or almost as expensive as the print versions.

There are several benefits to getting the NEJM on the kindle, and these benefits will likely lead all the major medical journals to follow suit at some point in the near future.The benefits:First, getting the kindle edition eliminates a ton of waste.  Walk into any serious doctor's home or office (or even medical library), and you will likely find stacks and stacks of journals.  Most copies sit there and collect dust...and only a few are used at any one point (what a waste of trees/paper and space).  At some point, all the old journals have to be tied up and recycled (or bound up) (another waste of time and energy).  The kindle version of the NEJM eliminates all this waste.Second, it is easier to read the NEJM off the kindle screen than a computer screen.Third, reading the NEJM off the kindle screen is almost as good as reading articles printed from the online journal...except, you eliminate the ink/tonor cost.Fourth, the kindle saves the old editions on the device for you (creating a virtual library)Fifth, the kindle will read the NEJM to you...by connecting into the speakers of your car stereo via a Coby cassette adapter.  The kindle therefore allows doctors to transform commuting (driving) time into more CME time.Sixth, doctors tend to be mobile and hard pressed for time--walking (running) throughout the hospital or from office to office.  It would be a god send to have all the major journals available at one's fingertips on an easy to read platform.  The kindle version of the NEJM is the first step toward this vision.  To expand on this thought--having ""Up to Date"" or other medical info. review sites available on the kindle would greatly add to its appeal.Disadvantage:  Charts and graphs in the articles are difficult to read on the Kindle 2. When you zoom in on the charts and graphs by placing the cursor over them, they are much easier to read.  If charts and graphs are very important to you, consider getting the Kindle DX, which reportedly makes charts and graphs much more readable.",376,A2TWCZ8PPPCG2D,NEJM is a medical pioneer,5,5.0,382,98.10,57.28,37.63,70.14,29.38,18.85,78.01,46.07,5.50,2.62,0.26,0.00,1.83,0.00,0.52,2.88,11.52,16.49,5.50,2.09,6.28,0.00,12.04,4.71,2.62,0.79,2.62,4.71,3.93,3.14,0.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.14,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,8.64,1.05,1.57,0.79,3.14,1.05,2.88,1.83,0.79,0.26,0.79,2.36,0.26,2.09,0.00,0.00,6.54,0.00,1.31,3.14,2.09,0.52,0.52,6.54,1.05,15.71,2.88,9.42,3.40,6.28,0.26,0.26,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.32,7.33,3.66,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.05,0.52,0.52,4.19,0.52

I am constantly looking for new and innovative ways to stay current with the medical literature. When I saw that the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) was available on the Kindle, I was ecstatic. The ability to have the NEJM delivered to me automatically, so I could peruse it at my leisure (and even have it read to me during my commute, as one previous reviewer pointed out) was very appealing. I own a Kindle v2, so my review is based on that platform.Overall, the articles are easy to read, and suffer very little from being converted to Kindle format, with one notable exception: the graphics and tables come across horribly on the Kindle screen. Figures which show baseline demographics of comparator groups are unreadable, even when zoomed. Black and white photos may or may not come across well, depending on the size and quality of the photo. These may be solved with the Kindle DX, but for those of us who have already invested in Kindle hardware, I'm certain you will experience the same frustrations. Amazon, if you hope to continue to gain additional readership from the medical community, and gain additional medical journal offerings, I highly suggest that something be done to correct this flaw. With a normal magazine article, pictures are often a nice addition, but not absolutely necessary. With medical literature, the figures and photos often give a vast quantity of data that are not contained elsewhere in an article. In other words, if I can't see the figure clearly, I can't interpret whether the article I'm reading is a quality article, and what impact it should have on the way I practice. I plan to give my NEJM subscription a couple more weeks to see if graphic quality is consistently poor. If so, I will discontinue my Kindle subscription, as the NEJM is widely available electronically via other means.Additionally, I mentioned that I was excited to have the Kindle read articles out loud while I was commuting to work. Unfortunately, due to the complex nature of medical terminology, the Kindle often butchers pronunciations, and stumbles over genetic information, abbreviations, etc. that are common in the medical literature. This makes articles read aloud via the Kindle almost incomprehensible. I much prefer to read articles the old fashioned way rather than have them read to me.That being said, I do find that having the NEJM available on my Kindle has increased the number of articles from the Journal that I take a serious look at (as opposed to just glancing over). Also, I have started bringing my Kindle on rounds with me. It fits very nicely into my lab coat pocket, and makes a handy reference tool (not to mention the wow-factor from other clinicians when I pull it out).Overall, 4 out of 5 stars for ease of use, portability, originality of concept, and wireless delivery.

In fact, the entire development of my time as a moderator at McCoveyChronicles has been fueled by my ability to ignore denigrating and trivializing criticism of Grant as I realize my dreams and my goals. However there is something compelling about Amazon's willingness to publish just about anything, and the sheer outrageous stupidity of many things some have said here that actually touches my proletarian and Democratic soul. Also I use and enjoy Amazon and I do read the reviews of other people's blogs in many fields. In sum, I believe in what happens here. And so, I speak. First off, let me say that this is addressed only to some of you, who have posted outrageously negative comments here, and not to all. You are interrogating this blog from the wrong perspective. Indeed, you aren't even reading it. You are projecting your own limitations on it. And you are giving a whole new meaning to the words ""wide readership."" And you have strained my obsessivegiantscompulivian principles to the max. I'm justifiably proud of saying that Grant is read by intellectual Giants fans and waitresses in trailer parks. In fact, I love it, but who in the world are you? Now to the blog. Allow me to point out: nowhere in this blog are you told that these are literally McCovey's Chronicles, nowhere are you promised on-topic subthreads or a humorless pedantry, nowhere are you told there will be in-depth coverage of every last rumored Matt Cain for Prince Fielder trade. The blog tells you exactly what to expect. And it warns you specifically that if you do not enjoy obscure references to the movie Red Dawn, listening to hipster nerd indie rock, or eating eggrolls, you may not enjoy this blog. This blog is written by a hero whom those of you writing negative reviews have already rejected. And he tells you that you are likely to reject him again. And this blog is most certainly written -- every word of it -- by Grant. Unless you count the people who write the FanPosts. Or, God forbid, the FanShots. If and when Grant can't write a blog entry on my own, you know about it. It happens. Sometimes people get married, or have kids, and have to put aside the blog writing for a day or two. That's what Josh From Hollywood and jponry are around for. And no, Grant has no intention of allowing any trusted moderator ever to distort, cut, or otherwise mutilate sentences that he has edited and re-edited, and organized and polished himself. He fought a great battle to achieve a status where he did not have to put up with trusted moderators making demands on him, and he will never relinquish that status. For Grant, blog writing is a virtuoso performance. It is not a collaborative art. Back to the blog itself: the man we typically love to hate is Brian Sabean. But since the World Series win, we've been with him more closely than we have ever been in the course of this blog; his roster moves have been as sensible to our minds as we've ever felt - and Grant vocalizes that. I've experienced breakthrough after breakthrough as I've read Grant's work, moved with him, saw through his eyes. Also, his windows. What I ask of Grant, Grant unfailingly gives. For me, three articles a week, two which make me laugh -- usually the Select Your Own Scenario or the one with the funny graph -- or even the one where Russel Martin sucks it -- are all Grant needs to do to earn his hefty SBN salary. They can be read aloud without a single hitch. Every word is in perfect place. The short series of posts about how the Giants won the World Series was for me a totally realized poem. There are other such entries in this blog. You don't get all this? Fine. But I experienced an intimacy with the Grant in those entries that shattered all prior restraints, and when one is reading one does have to continuously and courageously fight a destructive tendency to inhibition and restraint. That I have been able to get really close to the subject matter is an achievement that only increases my appreciation of Grant and his blog. Now, if it doesn't appeal to you, fine. You don't enjoy it? Read somebody else. But your stupid arrogant assumptions about Grant and what the members of his blog are doing are slander. And you have used this site as if it were a public urinal to publish falsehood and lies. I'll never challenge your democratic freedom to do so, and yes, I'm answering you, but for what it's worth, be assured of the utter contempt I feel for you, especially those of you who want us to go and read YOUR blogs instead (and perhaps repeatedly?) and how sad I am that Grant's blog - the first and last one I read every day - has invited your hateful and ugly responses. Now, to touch on another narrative you'll find at this blog: In ""Home Runs and Western Suns"", Barry Zito's wanting to be a saint is a vision larded through and through with his characteristic vanity. It connects perfectly with his earlier ambitions to be an actor in Paris, a rock star in the modern age. If you can't see that, you aren't reading TheLetter2's work! In Zito's conversation with the Pope he makes observations on the times which are in continuity with Aubrey Huff's observations five chapters earlier, and in continuity with Aaron Rowand's observations in all the way in the Epilogue. Barry Zito's state of mind has always been an important theme in ""Home Runs and Western Suns"" - though it tends to get overshadowed by all the Huff/Burrell slash. Zito's comments matter. Every word he speaks is part of the achievement of TheLetter2's work. That Zito renounced this saintly ambition within a matter of pages is plain enough for you to see. That he reverts to his old self is obvious, and that he intends to complete as many games as a Giant as he can is also quite clear. There are many other themes and patterns in this work that I might mention -- the interplay between Buster Posey and Tim Lincecum, the invisible bond that doesn't ""exist"" in the eyes of the front office is a case in point. There is also the theme of the lack of towels available in the visitor's locker room at Petco Park, the place where human existence becomes so beguiling that hitters simply relinquish their power as if to a spell. The entire relationship between Barry Zito and Jose Guillen is carefully worked out. But I leave it to readers to discover how this complex and intricate work of art establishes itself within a unique blog experience. There are things to be said. And there is pleasure to be had. And readers will say wonderful things about both McCoveyChronicles and ""Home Runs and Western Suns"" if they give them a chance. There are readers out there and plenty of them who cherish the individuality of each front page story on McCoveyChronicles which you so flippantly condemn. They can and do talk circles around you. And I am warmed by their response. Their letters, the papers they write in school, our face to face exchanges on the road -- these things sustain me when I read the utter trash that you post. But I feel I have said enough. If this reaches one reader who is curious about Grant's work and shocked by the ugly reviews here, I've served my goals. And Yo, you dude, the junk police! jponry and Natto are not clowns. They never have been and never will. But, for whatever sick reason, you probably wouldn't much like being around either one of them. And you wouldn't have to. If any of you want to say anything about all this by all means Email me at mopedtime34@yahoo.com. And if you want your money back for the blog, then screw you. It was 99 freaking cents.

Putting them on, though, made me a believer.The first thing I noticed is that the headphone cord, which is enclosed in a little fiber sleeve to prevent fraying, is not attached to the headphones, i.e. you get to pick which side is right and left. Neat little touch. The 3.5 jack is also constructed so that the plastic behind the plug is thinner than usual. This lets it plug snugly into my Fire HD 7"", which is protected by aleather casethat tends to make normal headphone plugs not go in all the way.The physical properties of the headphones alone are good, but they would mean nothing if the sound wasn's awesome - which, thankfully, it is. The Tribeca projects some serious bass for its size, but not so much that it overpowers the rest of the music unnecessarily. Whether I'm listening to hard rock, violins, Broadway or dubstep, the Tribeca performs admirably.My one, fairly minor, issue is that the Tribeca is not designed to fit large heads. I'm a fairly slender 6'1"" with an average-sized head for my height, and with the headphones at their maximum size (each size only extends about an inch) they just barely fit on my head, and I can't see myself wearing these for long periods of time because after about 15 minutes the plastic on the crown of my head starts to really hurt. If I wore a hat, that would put something between my scalp and the plastic, but I doubt the headphones would fit me then.Short of the the relatively small size of the headphones, these are a good product.

However, unlike the shoes these headphones were made in China, not Holland. Putting style aside, how is the sound and comfort of these headphones?Personally I was immediately impressed by the construction. The padded earphones are very comfortable though after a while I was conscious of the pressure on the stems of my glasses against my head. For extended listening sessions by wearers of spectacles, earbuds might be a little more comfortable. The headphones are nicely adjustable to find one's personal comfort zone.I really like the look of the wood on the headphones and the cord material used for the cables. These don't easily become knotted like the vinyl cords do.The sound emanating from these earphones is very good. I sampled them on my laptop, a Marquis 10"" pad, and the Kindle Fire. It may be my imagination, but I thought they sounded best on the Kindle. Also I compared the phones to an inexpensive MEE pair and a set of earbuds that are selling on Amazon at the moment for close to $180.  The Tribeca phones outperform the other two earphones easily. These Tribeca phones produce a full, rich sound, have nice separation, and good bass without distortion.

It covers a lot of powerful sales methods that are PROVEN to work. Experts use these methods to hit super sales levels. Previous reviewers of this book that have complained about these sales techniques just don't understand that these things work. People respond to ""power"" words and hidden commands to buy. It is a built-in unconscious response that can be measured in the lab. No matter how sophisticated we THINK we are, we all have certain buttons in our brains that smart marketers know how to push.As proof of this, just consider how a vast majority of us keep on working our fingers to the bones to keep paying for stuff we really don't need. Smart marketers just keep on pushing our buttons and we keep buying in to their vision of what they think we should have. The author of this book has studied the expert marketers and the psychology behind motivation and reveals the hidden secrets right here in his simple, easy to understand book that every book author should read and use to increase their sales.

""This material should be treated as a weekly newspaper, and if it isn't complete, I see no reason to pay for it in this hobbled format. I'll continue to read it on my computer, as I have done for years ... and if I really need an Onion fix, I'll hit the WAP version at [...].""He stormed off in a huff, shouting, ""Somebody please wake me if/when this gets fixed, and I'll sign up again.

They're all needlessly mangled in one way or another, but Politico manages to do a worse job than all I've seen. One problem has to do with they way they convert hyperlinks in articles--sometimes the link text is replaced with a URL, and sometimes the link text is missing entirely. The end result is something like:- This morning, President Obama signed the example.com/someurl, which, according to House Democrats, should solve the ongoing .Another fun touch, and I can't even offer a theory as to how this could happen, is that they randomly switch single and double quote marks, so you can't tell where internal quotes start and stop.

I didn't get a chance to explore the possibility of downloading the old issues on my kindle or other device before they are deleted from cloud.Second, after I realized what happened I decided to cancel the subscription. This time I downloaded all the issues in the cloud to my kindle(7 of them). I know they will delete the content from the cloud after it is cancelled. I got to access these seven issues from my kindle right after I cancelled subscription.I thought at least I got some damage control. today I turned on my kindle again and they disappeared. after 20 minutes on the phone I was told that it is Amazon' s policy to delete all issues from the KINDLE after the subscription is cancelled.

However to me this is a publication you want to keep as a reference in case you are ever going to make that exotic journey you planned and unfortunately this probably is not going to happen if you buy this from Amazon. There are a couple of things going on here.1) There are a limited number (7) of back issues issues that can be kept in the cloud. You can keep more on the Kindle Fire itself, however all the Fires including the new ones do not have expandable storage. Color magazines like these are not tiny files and if you have some music plus books plus back issues of a couple of magazines (like I do) then onboard storage starts to diminish pretty rapidly.2) And this is even more important. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ANY BACK COPIES STORED IN THE CLOUD. YES YOU LOSE WHAT YOU HAVE PAID FOR. Now again you can elect to ""keep"" the back copies on the KF but they eat up onboard storage and if you have several subscriptions you will have problems.It is much better to use the Z i n i o app and buy publications through them.

I am so ticked with getting taken in by another cliff hanger ending that I am using this open forum to spew my angst.  If that bothers you, do not read the review.In this half written tale of woe, we have Victoria/Shell who is devastated by the recent loss of her mother.  Her father, for reasons we don't know, has moved on really quickly to date, move in, and plan to marry Missy.  She comes with Nathan, her seventeen year old awesomely spectacular Dean's list super sports star son.  Now, I can forgive the Mary Sue Nathan, but the story just doesn't add up.For all intents and purposes, Victoria's mom and dad had a really great relationship until one night, her mom, who was wrapped up with work, left work late and died in an accident.  Her dad doesn't let her talk about her mom, he has HER get rid of all of her mom's things in order to make room for the new arrivals, and he is all about keeping Victoria down.  He jumps her case about everything- when he pays attention to her.  He adore Nathan and is completely oblivious to his own daughter's pain.  Makes no sense based on the inferences the author gives about their previous life.So, Nathan tells Shell/Victoria that she needs to loosen up and get smexed, because that's what all boys want.  So they come to a business agreement.... Which quickly gets revamped when Nathan gets cold feet.  He starts dating someone else, so does she, which culminates to a fight and &#34;I really like yous and we better tell everyone about us.&#34;Then suddenly, she is literally ripped- by the hair&#8211;- from her bed one night and hauled down the stairs by medical professionals?- who are there to &#34;get her help.&#34;  What?  Number one, no medical professional worth his or her salt is going to violently and angrily wake a potential patient from a sound sleep, by dragging them by the hair, down the stairs.  When her father, who is standing by, glaring, says that she will get the help she needs, he is ordered to not talk to the patient.  So now not only do we have an incomplete story, we have a complete cluster of half created drama that is completely UNNECESSARY.Sadly, I was enjoying the story of two messed up teens who were trying to make the best of things.  It was believable, for the most part.

Articles by Richard Collins and Peter Garrison were compelling and entertainingly educational. I left off my print subscription some time back and recently decided to start it up again on my Kindle. I found that it had turned into an advertisers paradise without very much to offer. Certainly it was nothing like it once was. I compare it to DISCOVER, which offers Kindle subscribers two versions in one, where we can see each page of the magazine faithfully represented, or select text view which displays like any book and contains no advertising. Flying has a tremendous opportunity with its inertia of longevity to provide pilots of all stripes the same wealth it once did, but has chosen to focus more on commercial advertising instead. I'm gravely disappointed and saddened that I have to recommend against others buying this magazine. Take the free trial if you wish, I think you will feel the same about the weight of advertising versus content, and the difficulty of reading articles. One has to zoom them and mess with positioning text.

Das FAZ-Abo auf dem Kindle vermittelt ein Gef&uuml;hl, wie ich es nur bei der ersten Verwendung eines Textverarbeitungsprogramms oder beim Einschalten des iPhones versp&uuml;rt habe. Im Einzelnen:Das Ger&auml;t wurde zwei Tage nach der Auslieferung in den USA morgens 10.00 Uhr an meiner Haust&uuml;r zugestellt. Weitere Zollgeb&uuml;hren fielen - anders als dies teilweise in der Presse verbreitet wird - nicht an. Sie werden von Amazon bei der Bestellung hier gleich zugeschlagen und abgewickelt. Nur das &Ouml;ffnen der kleinen Schachtel brachte einen D&auml;mpfer, den einzigen: Das Netzteil passt nur auf amerikanische Steckdosen. Rasch stellte sich heraus, dass es sich um einen Kombistecker aus USB- und Netzteil vglb. den Apple-Steckern handelte. Aber: Mit meinem Apple-Stecker konnte ich den Kindle merkw&uuml;rdigerweise nicht aufladen; dieser entlud sich sogar. Der Ladevorgang ging zun&auml;chst nur &uuml;ber den Computer! Schade: H&auml;tte Amazon vorher dar&uuml;ber informiert, dass ein Adapter ben&ouml;tigt w&uuml;rde, h&auml;tte sich gleich das bekannte Apple-Gef&uuml;hl eingestellt: Auspacken und sich sofort wohl f&uuml;hlen. Die n&auml;chste kleinere H&uuml;rde bestand darin, dass hier bei Amazon.com im Rahmen des eigenen Benutzerkontos die bereits angegebene Karte noch einmal f&uuml;r den Kindle freigegeben werden musste.Dann aber ging es los: Mit dem Kindle hatte ich die erste Ausgabe in ca. 5 Minuten nach Einleitung des Bestellvorgangs auf dem Bildschirm. Seit drei Tagen kommt das Blatt nach Einschalten des Ger&auml;ts p&uuml;nktlich morgens bei mir an (ich wohne auf dem Land und habe keine Empfangsprobleme).Die Handhabung selbst bedeutet f&uuml;r mich eine so eindeutige Verbesserung gegen&uuml;ber der &uuml;blichen Zeitungslekt&uuml;re wie oben beschrieben. Zu Hause sitzen wir mittlerweile zu Dritt am Tisch mit unseren Zeitungen; dies wird eng. Hier beginnt der erste und vielleicht entscheidende Vorteil: Die Handhabung der Zeitung ist wesentlich entspannender, wobei die Lesbarkeit in keiner Weise leidet. Ich nehme das Kindle (es ist so leicht, dass ich erst gar nicht nachgewogen habe) &uuml;berall hin mit und bekomme die Zeitung damit endlich (seit mehr als 10 Jahren) auch ausgelesen. Schaltet man das Ger&auml;t aus, merkt es sich die Stelle, an der die Lekt&uuml;re beendet wurde. Es hat ein &uuml;beraus edles Erscheinungsbild, das hier in der Fotoabbildung m.E. nicht so ganz deutlich wird. Die Steuerung ist leicht erlernbar und der einmal geladene Akku h&auml;lt jetzt bereits locker ein paar Tage. Einzelne Exemplare der Zeitung kann man schlie&szlig;lich archivieren, so dass sie dauerhaft auf dem Kindle bleiben.Der zweite Vorteil ergibt sich f&uuml;r mich daraus, dass ich meine Zeitung jetzt auch au&szlig;erhalb unseres Hauses bekommen kann (ich bin sehr h&auml;ufig unterwegs); ich brauche sie vor allem im Urlaub nicht mehr abzubestellen, um mich dann aus dunklen Kan&auml;len &uuml;ber das Geschehen zu Hause zu infomieren (bin gespannt, ob es auf den Malediven funktioniert!).Dritter Vorteil: Der Preis. Der oben angegebene Preis bezieht sich auf ein Monatsabo. Jeder kann im Internet nachsehen, dass man gegen&uuml;ber dem Hardcopy-Abo bares Geld spart.Verschwiegen sei allerdings auch nicht der einzige Nachteil: Bilder, Grafiken und Tabellen im Orginaltext werden im Kindle nicht abgedruckt. Ich kann dies verschmerzen; f&uuml;r viele k&ouml;nnte dies aber nicht akzeptabel sein. Daf&uuml;r aber finden sich nach meinem Vergleich alle Texte (auch typische Bildunterschriften, wenn diese eine eigene Information beinhalten) in der elektronischen Version.F&uuml;r mich hat sich der Kauf schon wegen dieses Abos gelohnt; englische B&uuml;cher werden sicher bald folgen.",562,A3H8JU8BEIDJK7,Atemberaubende Verbesserung gegen&uuml;ber Zeitschriftenabo!,4,5.0,656,91.40,48.17,1.00,25.77,25.23,21.49,10.52,3.51,0.91,0.91,0.91,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.61,1.22,1.07,0.61,0.61,0.00,3.35,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.61,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.30,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.15,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.35,0.00,1.68,0.00,1.52,0.15,0.15,0.00,1.22,0.00,0.00,2.29,1.83,0.00,1.52,0.30,0.30,0.00,27.13,4.88,2.90,1.52,7.62,0.00,0.46,1.22,0.00,0.00,1.83,6.71

Unfortunately, this switch didn't work out and it's not because the Kindle lacks whatever quality other reviewers miss but simply because FAZ does a very poor job delivering the newspaper.1) All pictures are missing. The Kindle can display b/w pictures quite well and they are important even for a serious newspaper. I really miss them (esp. when the article refers to the picture ""above"").2) There is no hyphenation. You simply cannot print German with its compound nouns on a narrow screen without hyphenation. It looks terrible and is unpleasant to read.3) A nice thing about a classical size newspaper is that you can quickly skim over articles and look for interesting stuff. There must be a way to implement this on the Kindle. Right now the navigation is too primitive.4) FAZ like all newspapers print many editions per night, starting at 18:00 CET with the first one that gets delivered to foreign countries. The last one (often after midnight) is then distributed locally in Frankfurt. They can be identical but often the 18:00 CET edition's headline is ""Close run in xyz elections"" while the midnight edition's headline would be ""Party xyz wins elections"". I understand that being remote, I cannot expect to get the midnight edition a couple of hours later. However, as a Kindle user I do expect to get the first edition and all subsequent updates. FAZ on my Kindle is older than the FAZ on paper that gets delivered to my door or the FAZ I can buy in the store next corner.

They communicate quickly via email and telephone wait times are negligible and short.  The Kindle Fire has it's own special dedicated customer service line and so service is even better for Kindle Users.DRAWBACK #1Only reason they get 4 instead of 5 stars is that this warranty does not cover loss or theft -- even with a deductible as a cellphone warranty would do.  Instead it only covers specific malfunctions repairs or breakage.  If your Kindle gets stolen you are out of luck.  Only good thing is that they offer a refund for the FULL lifetime of the Warranty.  They begin to pro-rate your refund at 90 days.  So if you loose or get your Kindle stolen within 90 days (like I did) you get a full refund.ALSO! DRAWBACK #2 You cannot transfer the warranty from NEW kindle to NEW kindle (see generous return/refund policy above).  So if you bought a new kindle and it is (lost or stolen or gone) and buy another brand new kindle you will have to buy a brand new warranty policy all over again.  You can transfer the warranty from registered kindle owner to registered kindle owner as it travels with the kindle, not with the owner.

I purchased a warranty for the monitor I gave my husband for Christmas last year, so I thought it was worth a call.  They did, indeed, offer me a five dollar reduction. They also stated that purchasing a warranty through Amazon requires it be done within 30 days. The site will sell the warranty up to 90 days after purchase. That sounded fine and, after all, five dollars is five dollars. I gave the product information and credit card number to make the purchase and had my warranty in my e-mail within five minutes.Having warranty in hand, so to speak, I proceeded to read it. Imagine my surprise when I found that I had paid $49.99 for $99.99 worth of coverage. In other words, I'd get back $50 if I made a claim on a $249 device. There is no sliding scale for depreciation. All the information of the policy was repeated back to me-the cost, that it covered spills, dropping crushing, etc. She didn't mention what is on the Amazon site-coverage for the general manufacturer's type warranty provided by Amazon for one year does not kick in from Square Deal until the second year.My issue: I spoke with Customer Service for ten minutes about coverage. At no time did ""Louise"" mention the value of my purchase. I didn't think to ask. I have a feeling I'm not in the minority. I think the omission was deliberate and I resent it.  Now, knowing it in advance, people reading this review might decide that it is a reasonable deal and gladly pay the price. I might do the same after reading this. However, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.When I called to cancel, I received the cancellation e-mail immediately while I held on to find out when the refund would post (3-5 business days). No immediate cancellation of charges, despite the policy was in effect for five minutes.If the coverage is glaringly obviously printed somewhere, I missed it.

I can't remember the specifics on calling into speak with customer service on my thrive, but I remember being happy with the outcome. They answered my questions and I purchased the warranty.Recently, my fire hd disappeared and I thought it was stolen. I bought a new one and called cs to see if I could transfer the warranty to the new fire hd. CS explained since it wasn't a replacement fire hd (that amazon or themselves didn't actually replace it) but rather a purchase, they could not transfer the warranty. However, he was able to cancel the warranty on the 'stolen' fire so that I could purchase a new warranty. He advised this way I would have coverage from the first date of purchase for the new fire. They processed this quickly and I was able to purchase my new warranty and bind it to the new fire hd.Then a few days later, I found my lost fire hd. I purchased a new warranty and then realized that the warranty was technically outside the 30 day purchase window for the old fire hd. I called customer service and they understood what happened and were able to make a one time exception since I had originally purchased it in the 30 day window. He was able to bind it to my old fire hd and that was that.Any time I have called, they have answered my questions, fixed problems within minutes of the call. No long waits for answers etc. They remind me of Amazon customer service.As for recommending this product, I would recommend an accidental warranty on any device that gets carried around. I don't do them on things like tvs, desktop computers, etc. But I always get them on nice phones, tablets, laptops because I do tend to drop things.

That meant a lot of back and forth, phone calls, etc that made me wish I had just asked for my money back.  Instead, I gave them the opportunity to make it right.So, while I gave my nephew the Kindle Fire for Christmas, he didn't receive the warranty until sometime in late February. While I did give this product a second star, they really need to provide an option to gift this to another person, by allowing you to enter the name of the recipient, at the point of sale.UPDATE - 26 Dec 2012 -So apparently, SquareTrade didn't like my feedback - I left them the exact same review that you see below (marked ""original review"").  I got an email from the person I spoke to on the phone - the same person who I had spoken to on the phone (by the way, what I failed to mention below is that while I was verbally told I could transfer the warranty to a minor, I was told to call back after the minor had registered the device.  How nice.).The email said the following (copied verbatim):Please accept my apologies for any inconvenience caused. We appreciate you taking the time to offer your comments. Rest assured, your message has been forwarded on to the appropriate members of our team for review. We believe that feedback from customers like you is an important part of our ongoing commitment to providing a quality service. Once again I sinserly apologize for inconvenience caused. Hope that answers your question! We believe that feedback from customers like you is an important part of our ongoing commitment to providing a quality service. Thank you,Aside from the typo, my issue was not addressed, my question was not answered and I was left angrier than if they had skipped the email.  I responded that no, my question hadn't been answered and now I didn't know who/what to believe.  No response.I received a voice mail from SquareTrade the next day - an apology for the confusion but no offer to actually ANSWER the question.  Two days later, I received the warranty in the mail with MY name on it!  Why on earth would you mark this as a gift if you can't actually gift the darn thing??I'm moving to get my money back and hope that my nephew never, ever drops the darn thing.  Save your money and your time and get a different warranty from a different vendor!------ (original review below)First, I purchased this warranty as part of a gift (I checked the ""gift"" box during checkout) along with the Kindle Fire HD for my nephew.  I then received, in my inbox, the warranty along with a ""congratulations on your new Kindle Fire HD and warranty"".  Um, no, it's a GIFT.Second, when I asked SquareTrade how to transfer the warranty to my nephew, I was told that I had to create an account to then transfer the warranty.  FOR A GIFT.Third, I was then informed by SquareTrade that I couldn't transfer a warranty to a minor.  Gee, don't you think you should have disclosed that BEFORE I purchased the warranty?  Fine, my sister-in-law will be the not-so-happy recipient of a warranty for a device owned by her son.Fourth, after creating the account to transfer the warranty, I discover that I can't transfer it - I have to call a special 1-800 number to do so because the warranty is for a Kindle.Fifth, I call the 1-800 number and am told that the process I was told to follow is incorrect and that you can transfer a warranty to a minor.  Now I have no clue what to believe and I still don't have the warranty in the correct name.This process stinks and had I known how onerous it would be, I would have skipped it altogether.  I seriously hope my nephew doesn't ever need to use this warranty because I can't even imagine how hard it would be to get his device fixed!

I'm giving up and canceling my subscription.ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is not an opinion of the quality of the Statesman but a comparison of the printed paper with the Kindle edition.  The Kindle has no pictures, no ads, no weather, and no TV listings.  Most articles from the paper are in the Kindle but not all - no pattern I can detect for the omissions.  For example on Sun 3/29 only 2 of 4 articles on the front page were in the Kindle edition.  The Life and Arts section only appears in the Sunday version of the Kindle - not in weekday versions.  The sports section is pretty complete but of course no box scores or charts. The editorials and letters to the editor are included. The Kindle stories almost always have a different headline from the real paper, but the text is normally the same in both places. The Nation and World section is pretty complete and includes articles from AP, NY Times, and the Washington Post among others. No inserts are included so no neighborhood editions or Parade on Sunday.  The Statesman web site has a more complete version of the newspaper and it is more current, but if the Kindle is your preferred reading method this is a reasonable, if incomplete, version of the local Austin newspaper.",296,A1JVC1SE0K59O2,It's not an electronic edition of the paper,8,3.0,289,93.16,11.31,68.40,38.04,22.23,21.80,80.97,51.56,4.15,2.42,2.08,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,1.73,13.84,12.80,7.61,2.42,7.96,4.15,9.34,3.81,3.46,0.00,2.42,3.46,2.77,1.73,1.04,0.00,0.00,0.69,1.38,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,13.15,0.69,0.35,1.73,4.15,1.73,7.61,0.69,0.69,0.00,0.00,0.69,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.35,1.38,0.35,0.00,0.35,0.35,0.35,1.73,8.65,0.00,15.22,0.69,8.30,5.88,5.54,1.04,0.35,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.76,4.84,3.11,1.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.69,0.00,0.35,1.38,0.35

Is ""Text View"" a relatively new feature on the Fire, which was only implemented after these reviews were made? In which case, good! It seems that was really needed. Or is that a feature which not enough people are aware of? I guess I don't know, but the point is, using that makes reading this (and other magazines) a perfectly easy thing to do. In ""Page View"", the content is presented exactly identical to the printed magazine, so if you prefer that, it's there. You'll see images as if the magazine was just scanned as-is. In ""Text View"", though, content is present just like any other Kindle book, and is just as easy to read.That said, I highly recommend The Week magazine. The content is fantastic. The Week does more than just cover the news, but also how others are covering that news. Every story is approached from the angle of: this happened, and this is what so-n-so said about it, however this other opposing opinion was also said by someone else. It's a really great way to understand what's going on, without any detectable bias. Although it's been said that if you think a source doesn't have a bias, that just means the bias it does have agrees with your own, I still believe that is not the case here.It's also worth noting, the above method is how this magazine approaches ALL of their articles, not just those regarding politics (both domestic and international, by the way).

Unfortunately, as already stated by others in their reviews, the Kindle Fire edition is virtually unreadable in the standard magazine view format.  The text is too tiny to read, pinch and zoom is an option but results in unwanted page turns, double tap to zoom works better but requires you to frequently zoom in and out - an annoyance that takes too much time.For those unfamiliar with ""The Week""'s layout, it is a highly useful feature.  Two page spreads often have a small map of the world in the bottom center, with columns on each page pointing to the map.  The reader can quickly spot articles that pertain to regions of interest.  However, reading the articles on Kindle Fire in text view (the only truly readable view) completely eliminates the usefulness of this feature and the layout.As far as content, The Week is a great quick summary of world news and events; 45-55 pages.

B00K8LRTLE,Kindle Store,"[10, 11]",3.0,0.8181818181818182,4.76,5.0,"Having read JC Ryan&#8217;s previous book, &#8216;The Tenth Cycle&#8217;, I knew the second one would either be a let-down or at least equal to the first book in terms of all its literary qualities. But I&#8217;m glad to report that this second book, &#8216;Ninth Cycle Antarctica&#8217;, sets the bar significantly higher in all aspects: from suspense, to the depth and intricacy of plot, to pacing, to masterful storytelling, and even the overall entertainment value. Indeed, author JC Ryan took on the challenge of writing an even greater book&#8212;and succeeded in a flourish.The book, this time, is about the mystery surrounding Antarctica, somehow ushered in by the video footage salvaged from a doomed Navy SEAL mission in the said continent. The footage seems to indicate intriguing artefacts buried under the perma-ice. But this is only the tip of the iceberg (pun intended), as what really gets the folks at the Rossler Foundation itching for answers is the existence of a map that accurately shows the coastlines of Antarctica&#8212;a map that could have possibly be drawn from space, with the use of advanced imaging equipment able to penetrate the ice cover. But there&#8217;s one major catch: the said map was made in the 16th century, and the sheer lack of answers as to how that was possible propels Rossler Foundation&#8217;s Charles Summers to head over there and investigate. Joining their team is a wild card: marine veteran Josh Rossler, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, haunted by his demons and his guilt. Of course, what&#8217;s a Rossler Foundation mission without the murderous intervention of the Orion Society, who stealthily infiltrates Summers&#8217; team, with the ultimate goal of taking over once summers and his men are dead.Now, if that fails to get your juices flowing, then nothing will. Because, at bottom, the &#8216;Ninth Cycle Antarctica&#8217; is a darned great read&#8212;author JC Ryan masterfully uses the kind of stuff you usually find featured on shows like &#8216;Ancient Aliens&#8217;, intricately weaving such mysteries in such a believable plot that you&#8217;ll find your heart racing merely a few pages into the book. The magic thing that holds the whole plot together is JC Ryan&#8217;s literary craftsmanship&#8212;he has that uncanny knack to put little &#8220; plot bombs&#8221; along the way, compelling you to keep on turning the pages as he carefully strikes a balance between his careful use of verisimilitude and jaws-dropping plot twists. When I say you will not put this book down, I&#8217;m not kidding.Thoroughly satisfying, &#8216;Ninth Cycle Antarctica&#8217; is a definite must-read&#8212;and if I may say, should also have a movie version. Fans of suspense thrillers who love well-woven conspiracy theories and a bit of romance on the side will find their thirst slaked.

I realize that Heartiste was trying to be cheeky with &#8220;Dark Enlightenment,&#8221; but apparently none of the nerds who picked that phrase up got the subtext. Now it sounds like something that a 15-year old goth would come up with while browsing the discount rack at Hot Topic. &#8220;Ooooh, look at me! Look how DARK and EVIL I am!&#8221; For the rest of us, we&#8217;re just neoreactionaries.But what is neoreaction? Anarcho Papist author Bryce Laliberte answers the question in this debut book, an absolute must-buy for anyone interested in the predominant ideology of the &#8216;sphere. I don&#8217;t recommend it for absolute beginners, as Laliberte&#8217;s book assumes some basic familiarity with the writings of Mencius Moldbug and other major thinkers, but if you&#8217;ve already gotten your feet wet, Neoreaction will help you better understand how the world works.Don&#8217;t be fooled by the book&#8217;s short length; this is a dense work that requires careful thought and a re-read or two. Laliberte begins by defining ideology itself, its purposes and how it sustains itself. From this, he carefully explains not only why neoreaction is right, but what fundamentally separates it from other ideologies; namely, the fact that it doesn&#8217;t rely on popular consensus to function, nor can it.Laliberte&#8217;s prose is similar to his blog posts; very formal and intellectual without being showy. It won&#8217;t win any awards, but he conveys his ideas and beliefs in an erudite way. Additionally, Neoreaction is largely free of the jargon that characterizes this part of the Internet (such as &#8220;Cathedral&#8221; or &#8220;Brahmin&#8221;), giving it a greater professionality than the usual fare.From the introduction, Laliberte moves on to define neoreaction as the only ideology capable of sustaining a civilization. As he points out, organized society is no accident; in particular, he credits the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages for setting the stage for later European glory by forbidding inbreeding and encouraging exogamous marriage. He coins the term &#8220;biopolitics&#8221; (fortunately unrelated to that fraud Foucault and his nonsense idea of &#8220;biopower&#8221;) to describe the eugenic and demographic trends that make civilization possible.Laliberte lays the blame for modernism at the feet of the Protestant Reformation (or as he calls it, the &#8220;Protestant Formation&#8221;), not exactly an original assertion, but he cuts to the heart of why Protestantism was so corrosive to European culture; it represented the destruction of hierarchy. Martin Luther&#8217;s assertion of salvation through faith alone and assertion that laymen could interpret Scripture for themselves annihilated the hierarchy of the old Catholic Church. It is from this that we come to the radical egalitarianism of modern leftists, in which all races are equal, men and women are interchangeable, and no one is better than anyone else. Even so-called conservatives and libertarians are afflicted with this disease; as Laliberte points out in his critiques of libertarianism, they assume an egalitarianism of opportunity flying in the face of racial and gender differences.Despite Laliberte&#8217;s religious biases, his later arguments in favor of neoreaction spring from entirely logical and sensible foundations. For example, he provides a secular justification for patriarchy based in the biological realities of masculinity and femininity. Patriarchy is the only system in which both the strengths of men&#8212;risk-taking and courage&#8212;and women&#8212;child-rearing and nurturing&#8212;are used to their fullest benefit, while feminism blunts both. All of this is a massive oversimplification of Laliberte&#8217;s ideas, by the way. Get the book for the full flavor.If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;d criticize What is Neoreaction? for, it&#8217;s that it feels incomplete. While Laliberte explicitly states in the opening paragraphs that his book is not intended to be an introductory text, it could have easily become one&#8212;and thus a more valuable book&#8212;had he lengthened it by just a couple of chapters.Still, these are all minor dings. What is Neoreaction? is absolutely worth checking out if you&#8217;ve been reading up on neoreaction and want to fully understand it or if you&#8217;re a neoreactionary who wants to better clarify your ideas.",691,A1TR8S5FHNKH51,Good summary of neoreaction's ideas,5,5.0,779,82.92,61.63,10.13,71.55,32.46,24.13,74.20,46.34,11.94,4.36,0.90,0.39,0.77,1.93,0.39,7.57,7.32,13.09,4.62,3.34,6.68,1.03,8.86,4.75,2.95,1.80,6.16,2.05,5.01,3.72,1.28,0.13,0.51,0.13,7.45,0.13,0.00,0.39,2.57,12.32,3.34,1.80,1.28,2.70,1.80,3.72,1.28,0.51,0.13,0.39,1.03,0.77,0.13,0.00,0.00,5.26,1.03,1.67,1.93,1.54,0.39,1.67,6.42,0.26,8.60,0.64,5.65,2.31,2.05,0.90,0.00,0.77,1.54,0.00,0.64,0.00,0.51,0.13,0.00,0.00,26.70,3.59,4.36,0.13,5.78,0.51,0.26,0.90,0.00,0.00,0.39,10.78

And don't let anyone kid you, the freebies here will often surprise you with their quality of content.There appear to be over a million titles available at the Kindle Store, and that number continues go grow.  Within these are many thousands of free titles.  There are older out-of-copyright (pre-1923 books) classics of all types mingled in with titles as new as today.  If one has time or the inclination to wade through these, then there is enough there to keep one busy for many hours.  But for those of us who have other time priorities, Michael Gallagher has done the work of compiling many these, with frequent postings.  There are days where a few of these may appear, so it's wise to turn on your Kindle daily or at least a few times a week to take advantage of these freebies... and some of them are available at no cost for a very short time.One of his more recent postings offered the following: ""There are approximately 500 new free non-public domain books in the Amazon Kindle store this morning for a total of 4,122 as I type this post.""  There was  a discussion about this, and he went on to say, ""As usual, I do not know how long these will be offered for free so if you are interested in any or all of them, please grab them now!""  Very sage advice, indeed.This Kindle blog is not just another online link to a list of titles, as are some.  Mr. Gallagher's postings also include frequent insider tips and helpful information that help to use your Kindle, and these are designed for novices to experienced users alike.  This one has been ranked as the top Kindle blog since 2010 for good reason.  It's highly-recommended, and comes with a risk-free 14-day free trial.

My main issue with it is that I get an occassional buffer glitch with Pandora from my Kindle when it's connected to this speaker over bluetooth - however I can't know for sure if it's my internet, kindle or speaker without more testing.  So, I won't deduct points for that without further testing.  The sound quality is fairly clear and EQ balance is set nicely within its limitations so that you get a good clear range of sound and not a muddy or tinny mess like some of these smaller speakers.  I will say the kickstand is flimsy and doesn't stay open well when trying to set it up, but once it's set it is fine and certainly isn't going to fall over.  That's not really a big deal.  The speaker did move around on the table when I was pushing the volume limits to test the sound quality.  At normal listening levels it will not move around.  My expectations were fairly low after purchasing a similar type and size of speaker from SimplyVibe which completely died after 6 weeks.  When that one did work, it didn't sound as nice as this one.

Unfortunately, each of the first two Kindle-edition of Narrative likewise had, as flagship fiction content, novel excerpts.This bothers me . . . a lot.I looked on the Narrative web site. they have tons of bona fide short stories they can provide, both from established and emerging authors. Why on earth are they wasting space on content that cannot and was never intended to stand on its own?Actually, I think I can guess the answer. Let's call these novel excerpts what they really are: advertorials (magazine advertisements disguised to look like content). What else can they possibly be? I don't know if Narrative is getting paid by the authors to run these, but if they aren't, then that's their own foolishness because the authors certainly should pay if they are going to consume so much space to promote their novels. Whatever the case, that's between Narrative and the authors; it's none of my business.Interestingly, I find I can browse Narrative's web site and download a lot of interesting stories for free. If I want to read them on Kindle, that's easy enough; I can just send them over, and even use Amazon's PDF-Kindle conversion service.

I was ambivalent at first: the submission fees they charge their writers were way above industry standards, and shortly thereafter all the literary magazines followed suit, so as if writers weren't exploited enough to always work for free, now they're expected to pay, and pay solidly, to have their hard work displayed on a website.But this is not the worst of it. I could live with it if the quality of the writing is good.  But here is the other thing: Narrative publishes on average only one or two new writers.  Most of their submissions are from already top-tiered well known writers, the SAME ONES appearing issue after issue.  Women writers are limited to the biggest names: Jayne Anne Phillips, etc.  These writers, I later found out, do not pay to have their work published.  They are solicited and paid big bucks from the funds collected of lesser known (but no less talented) writers.Finally, as if this weren't enough, today's issue publishes prominently what is advertised as a ""GREAT NEW GRAPHIC SHORT STORY.""The story: a girl is driving home, thinking about the great sex she had with her new guy.  Is she in love? She feels like a horse and her boyfriend is the rider.Action? A girl drives homePlot? NoneConflict? NoneWhat do we know about this character? nothing. She's a girl. She likes sex.Art?

It is wonderful to have a newspaper in the kindle but they need to do some organization to overcome the small screen.

You won't find U.S. domestic issues here, but you will find a good deal of U.S. political/financial information.Nicely laid out. Improvements that could be made have more to do with the Kindle itself than anything about the paper. There are a few photos ... just enough to be interesting. They are of medium quality but do break up the text.Because it is so easy, I find myself reading on a much wider range of global topics. So I spend a lot of time with IHT, and sometimes struggle to keep up with the issues as they roll in.I think this is a very balanced paper ... neither extreme right nor extreme left. I have not read anything in over a month of subscribing that made me go ""ah hah, someone has an axe to grind here"" ... something the parent company (NYT) often triggers in me. They seem to have taken a hands off approach to IHT, perhaps increasing emphasis on US content, but not (so far as I can see) injecting a lot of bias.The one paper I would very much like to see on Amazon is the Financial Times. That plus IHT would give you pretty much everything you need to know about what is going on in the world. I also read Newsweek for a bigger picture overview - that fills in some of the domestic issue gaps.

However, I did not enjoy this book.The plot was drawn out unnecessarily due to characters not sharing necessary information with the main character.  Her mother leaves her alone for weeks in situations that she has to know will be dangerous (she knows others are watching over her, but she still doesn't seem to care about what is going on in her daughter's mind).  She asks questions and characters who are supposed to be on her side respond with things like ""If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.""  The main character doesn't ask questions about things that are clearly out of the ordinary.  At one point, she reveals that she doesn't go to the bathroom normally.  Not only does that not make sense (I mean, not that I want to know, but what is she talking about?), but why is she not concerned about it?  How is she going through life with superhuman strength, speed, and unspecified bathroom issues and not in the least bit worried or concerned about it?The story was full of the wish fulfillment that is too typical of the genre.  Zillael is much more beautiful than her classmates (something you hear about in great detail throughout the book), but she hates all of them.  Why?  Absolutely no reason.  But then she gets involved in a hot love triangle just out of the blue.  She hates the town she lives in, so she never makes an effort to do anything more than sit around, eat salad, and mope.  I got so sick of her within the first few chapters.The writing is in desperate need of some good editing.  Punctuation was slipshod.  ""McDonald's,"" the most widespread and successful restaurant on earth, was misspelled (""Mac Donalds"").  How does that even happen?The style was confusing.  The item description clearly states that this is adult, not YA.  Unfortunately, the only remotely adult content is the book is a brief and not terribly explicit scene towards the end of the book.  The tone and style of the book was clearly YA.  I can't imagine too many adults being interested in Zillael and her silly problems or being able to maintain interest in the unnecessarily drawn out and sketchy plot (just making up different names for vampires is not the same thing as coming up with a story).  Adding an adult scene to a YA book doesn't make it an adult book.

Due to limitations of the technology, there are currently limits to what can be placed in the electronic version but at a minimum, all of the non-graphical content should be included and if possible the photos associated with an article, like the front page, editorial, regional news, etc.  The current version of the kindle version has a selection of the frontpage, everyday, and Sports sections.  I am still finding it necessary to go to [...] in order to get St. Louis news.A good example of kindle versions of a paper is the San Jose Mercury News, and the The Oklahoman.  Both of these papers include all of their print content, including regional news, but also includes some articles only found on their web pages.  They also have their papers priced at a lower price.I really want the Post Dispatch on my Kindle, but this is not worth $6.99 a month.  Unlike most internet users, kindle users typically do not mind paying for their news, but you have to provide value for the content.  If a user still has to go to the web page to catch what they miss in the Kindle version, then at some point they are going to question why they are paying a premium for something they get for free online.-dhickman",287,A3JO1HY7YWW8IG,You can do better than this.,6,1.0,283,91.74,28.59,73.32,25.77,23.58,21.20,79.86,53.00,9.54,6.71,3.18,0.00,0.35,0.00,3.18,2.83,11.66,15.19,7.07,5.30,5.30,0.71,9.89,1.41,1.06,1.41,0.71,2.12,2.12,1.06,1.06,0.00,0.00,1.06,4.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.37,1.41,0.35,1.41,3.18,1.41,6.36,0.71,0.71,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.35,2.83,0.00,0.71,1.06,1.06,0.00,1.77,10.25,0.71,15.19,2.12,6.01,6.36,3.18,0.35,0.00,2.12,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.49,6.36,5.65,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.71,0.71,0.00,0.00,1.06

Why? Okay, I adore Ally's writing, her characters and both the Heist Society and the Gallagher Girl series have me on the very edge of my seat waiting for the next (and final) installments. So this morning when I poured my cup of coffee and checked my kindle for the download, I may have breathed a sigh of relief that it was yes indeed, there.Macey McHenry, the senator's daughter, cosmetic heiress and Gallagher Girl waited for me to read her words as she described her first impression of the always dreamy W. W. Hale, V. And Macey must never be kept waiting. It was so logical for them to meet up because, after all, they do run in the same social circles. The tension, flirtation and most of all their cooperation in working together made for some tense page turning moments.The story is short but satisfying and yes, it does feature two of my other favorite people from both of the series. I won't spoil it for you; you have to read it yourself. And hey, it's FREE. Many thanks to Disney-Hyperion for giving us this satisfying treat while we wait for Perfect Scoundrels release on February 5th.Oh and if you download Double Crossed now, you will also get the first chapter of Heist Society and the first two chapters of Gallagher Girls #1 (I'd Tell You That I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You).

I always buy her books and read them the day they come out, so I am a BIG fan. I was so excited that she mixed her worlds in this novella. I thought it was really well done and was not disappointed. I think she should (at least) have run-ins between the characters in both the Heist Society books and the Gallagher Girls series because it always makes the books more fun when an author included character from different series, even for just a `cameo' appearance. Ally Carter was kind enough to make this free so you should definitely buy it. If you have never read any of her books, this is a good starting point.

The cover folds back for easy reading and returns back to a protective cover with ease.  It uses the Kindle 2 mounting system which is simple, clean and effective.

Even the packaging and accessory was nice. I also hooked them to my IPOD for a day  to check out the sound on another device, and it is quite good. These come with a nice little case and three adjustable ends, allowing you to form fit these to your ears.They are inner ear headphones, inserts, and they really kill any and all sound coming from the outside. I prefer this type to most others because of the way they eliminate background sound, and the deign of this pair counters a lot of other shapes. Shaped like a small bullet, they fit down in the ear well, creating a seal I've had trouble getting with a lot of other types. This allows for a crisp sound that pumps straight in. I like the sound quality a lot, impressed with it, with music coming through nicely and voices coming through well.The way they are made is nice, too, with the cord designed to be flush instead of round, eliminating the feeling that they might get caught on something and wear away. I've had that issue with other headphones, time allowing them to be ground down or accidents rubbing them to the core, but both the material and the design should keep that from transpiring. It also makes the cord feel lighter, which is something I appreciate. White for left ear, red for right, little things like this also make things better.The microphone works great on these too. It has a simple control on the right side cord. Press it to switch over, press it again and its back to whatever you were doing. I'm sometimes bad about going from talking to folks to listening to music to letting me Kindle read books to me, and this lets me switch off tasks easily.Good quality, good product.

This pair from Dulcia fits the bill perfectly for that purpose...very compact(as you would expect), and the microphone works very well.  I have made a few calls home and my family hears me very clearly, and I also have no problem hearing them.I have also used them to listen to music and movies, and in that regard the sound is also excellent, although as a disclaimer, I am in no way what you would call an ""audiophile.""  I wish they had a noise cancellation feature, but that's not really what they were designed for.  I use a different set of headphones for air travel to block out the engine noise.  During music playback, you can click the mic button to pause the music, or double click it to skip to the next song, or triple click it to go to the previous song.If a call comes in, you can click the mic button once to take the call, or hold it a couple of seconds to decline the call.  You can also initiate a call waiting function with the mic button.  Remembering all of this will take some practice ;).I will also note that I don't quite get the part about these headphones being touted as being for the Kindle Fire HD.  They're just headphones, and they'll work the same for most any device that will accommodate a set of standard headphones such as these.BTW, don't get too excited about the included case.  It's not much, and I probably won't even use it.The biggest drawback to me regarding these headphones is the price.  As of this writing, they run $65, and there are options out there as good as these for less money.

The story, while somewhat original, is very vulgar. The author uses profanity in what seems like every conversation/thought. Profanity should be used sparingly, to provide emphasis, not just because one can. Other problems that I had with it: 1) The protagonist keeps making poor choices even though he keeps being warned against them, but no sound reasoning is provided as to why he should ignore that advice. 2)The author plainly wrote this with a sequel in mind. There are various story threads that aren't explored and whole references that aren't explained at all. (For example, there is a cult but why they are targeting the protagonist is never explained - they just suddenly appear and just seem like they have nothing better to do than attack the protagonist.)

He struck me at the time as an author who was still coming into his own and who had the potential to craft very interesting stories populated by less interesting characters. It seems that my hopes that time and experience writing would improve his narratives have been in vain. The main character is portrayed as a comedian but never comes across as one. You would think the occasional joke to deal with the stress of his situation or as a way for him to normalize the craziness that is going on around him would be an obvious thing for the character to do. Instead of using the background for the character in some way defining him as a person it serves as little more than a paper thin back drop to explain away a few details of the plot, i.e. why he was rich.Speaking of the plot, while I can understand a character acting irrationally in an extreme situation, I can't get behind a story whose only way to drive the plot forward is for the protagonist to continually and purposefully screw-up. If he was told not to press a button he immediately would and that would take us to the next scene.I get that there are dumb and irrational characters in literature but why can he never seem to learn anything from his constant stream of mistakes?It is a frustrating and mind boggling process until one realizes that this is the only way that the author has to drive his story forward. A story, by the way, that comes dangerously close to cribbing from such other back from the dead revenge fantasies, such as Spawn and The Crow to name a couple.There's some potential here, but thus far Mr. Platt does not seem like the he's up to it. If it's a lack of ability or just laziness on the writer's part I will give the same advice; Try harder to make us care about the characters and make them people instead of card board cut outs.",355,A3Q5KZ7BB2BZ98,A book that wishes it was a tv show,9,2.0,360,79.10,59.88,15.86,21.50,40.00,16.39,86.67,59.17,13.61,7.78,2.22,0.56,0.28,4.44,0.28,5.83,10.56,16.67,8.06,6.39,6.94,1.39,15.28,6.11,4.17,1.39,0.56,2.22,5.83,2.78,3.06,0.83,1.11,0.00,9.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.44,13.61,2.78,1.94,2.78,4.17,0.83,3.89,1.11,0.00,0.28,0.56,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,4.72,0.56,1.94,0.83,0.83,0.56,1.94,11.11,1.39,13.33,2.50,7.78,4.72,1.67,0.83,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.28,0.56,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.89,4.17,2.22,0.00,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.28,0.00,1.67,0.00,0.00

Her heroine, Wally Morris, however, feels like an old friend to me.  She is the reliable sort of woman that you know will always offer to help, and sincerely mean it, especially during an extreme situation. Whether or not that help will be truly useful, or just muck things up further, is a different question, of course. Although I often fear good-hearted Wally is going to inadvertantly screw things up beyond repair, she hasn't let anyone down yet. Wally has enticed me to read a few of the books in this series.

The first, and biggest thing, is how hard it is to a) get a paperwhite into the cover, and b) get it straight once it's in!

Once I got it in, the Kindle was askew, which necessitated fiddling with it for several minutes to try to get it in correctly.

But there was one other issue. I flip my cover folded back to read, which I'm sure a lot of people do. Most covers handle this fine.

My personal politics/beliefs don't always coincide with their opinion sections/editors, but I can still overlook our differences and realize it's really a @#$%ing fantastic paper.I'm horrible at getting around to recycling and Catholic guilt kills me, so I said in a conversation ""if they had an electronic version, I'd buy one of them there Kindle thingies"".  Found out they did, ordered a Kindle, and immediately subscribed to the electronic version.  A quick version of this review -- yesterday I called the St Pete Times and had them convert my daily subscription to Sunday-Only.Cons:- I miss the layout (visual) of the paper.- Less stories make it.- Less pictures make it (St Pete Times has AWESOME photographers!)Pros:- While I miss the layout.. I find the ""shotgunning"" of the articles finds me quickly reading the articles I want to read in depth, but still skimming through and getting the basic gist (sp?) of ALOT more of the news.  I find that I'm actually reading way more of the paper.- It's there when I wake up in the morning -- I'll be honest, on weekends, I found I'd read most of the paper by the web version before I'd bother breaking out of my cave and venturing out in the burning sunlight to grab the physical paper, so now it's available with a nice small portable device.  Much better for the lazy vampires like me to haul into the bathroom for my ""morning meditation"" than a full laptop.Cons I really want fixed:- Less stories.  My biggest problem -- today is likely the last non-Sunday I'll get the paper, and I compared it to the electronic version.  There were 5 stories on the front page (I believe -- I left it in the truck with the other 200 copies I need to clean out, and don't feel like going out to grab it in my boxers at 11:30 at night), but the electronic version had only 2.  I think every story that ranks important enough to hit the front page (actual full stories, not the small left-side-bar stuff) should be in the electronic version, period.- Less pictures.  I guess I should clarify that -- while some graphics/charts/etc are great, let's be honest -- this isn't USA Today.  When I say pictures, I actually mean photographs.  I know that the goal is to limit the size of the file (due to likely costs for shipping the data via the ""Free"" 3g), and I know that it's probably a pain trying to b+w the photos so they look good on the e-ink screens... please, MORE PHOTOS.  St Pete Times sees fit to pay alot of GREAT photographers money to get their work, and I pay the St Pete Times to get their paper... I'd REALLY like to see them more!  If this is easier, how about just add a few more to stories, then even have a section that's a compilation of various photos at the end.  (That suggestion is due to me not knowing how the Amazon Kindle-format/package stuff is generated...maybe that'd make it easier to create, etc...)Readers Digest/""tl;dr"": I'm pretty happy over all.  I'd hoped their price'd be a bit smaller (I want the sunday printed edition for coupons... rough math shows I'm probably saving 10 - 20 bucks/yr doing sunday delivery+Kindle, but lack of papers laying around and feeling a little nicer about treating the environment is OK), but I find I'm reading more of the paper.

It is fun seeing the relationship between Nash and Tod while they are both alive, and finally learn the details about how Tod died.  Plus there is an interesting twist at the very end that I'm betting will come into play in the future.Free is free, and it's fantastic that Rachel keeps releasing these free novellas, but my big disappointment is that after waiting this long to get inside Tod's head, he doesn't answer the questions I've been dying to know. REAPER doesn't go on long enough for Tod to see Kaylee.  I know he likes her, there have been too many hints for him to only think of her as Nash's girlfriend, but I was really hoping to learn how much.  I hope that maybe Rachel is planning on writing more from Tod's perspective, because this taste isn't enough.I would recommend not reading REAPER until after you've read MY SOUL TO STEAL as I think the introduction to Nash's ex-girlfriend and their relationship is better swallowed in the past tense.  In REAPER, it's more than a little unsettling to see Nash all Bonnie and Clyde with her.  More so if you haven't seen what happens in MY SOUL TO STEAL.

I'm currently subscribing to the print edition also.  The Arizona Republic is actually a very good paper.  In additional to the typical fare, they have a fair amount of well-researched and in-depth investigative type articles. Its conservative leanings are obvious and it does live up to its nickname ""The Arizona Republican.""  However, it does seem that the editors try to be somewhat fair handed and overall it's more right of center, than far right.  Occasionally it will take a stand on an issue that some would consider being progressive or moderate, or dare I use the word. . . ""Liberal.""This is my review of the Kindle Edition of the Arizona Republic.Pros:* So far it has always arrived on time.  It is already in my Kindle when I get up at 5 a.m.  That is actually much earlier than the print edition.  This is a big plus if you are an early riser or have leave the house early for work.* Almost all of the ""articles"" and many of the ""columns"" are there and they seem well formatted.* Like other Kindle periodicals there is a high level Section List that shows the sections (e.g. ""Front Page,"" ""Valley and State,"" etc.)  Within each section you can access a list of the articles it contains in the event that you want to jump to a certain one.* There are no ads.  This is actually a pro and a con because sometimes it's nice to see what sales are going on.  However, I'm glad the ads are gone.* It contains many (but not all) of the ""Regional"" (e.g. East Valley) section pieces.* There are also the advantages of Kindle newspapers that all of them share, not just the Republic.  You can take it wherever you go, such as on vacation.  I always feel rushed in the morning and rarely have time to read as much as I want.  It's nice to be able to read it during lunch or other times (e.g. Dr's waiting room) when you have free time.  You can search the paper on keywords. You can clip articles future reference.  You don't end up with a stack of papers at the end of the week so you can feel more ""green.""Cons* Price. Almost all ""local"" US Kindle papers are around $6/month.  The Republic is priced at $10/month, which is similar to Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, or the LA Times.  I'm not sure if the Republic considers itself to be comparable to papers like the Washington Post or Wall Street Journal but it seems they have placed a premium on the Kindle edition. At this price, it's not that much less than Home Delivery.  If the price was more reasonable I would probably subscribe to both editions (print and kindle).  However, given the price, it's hard just justify that.  The Republic may actually lose some revenue by pricing the Kindle so high.  I would think more people would subscribe if the price was lower.* Absolutely nothing that isn't straight, paragraph formatted text. (e.g. no charts, illustrations, tables, lists or photos).  I know the Kindle is mostly a text based device but some other newspapers have photos  with some articles.  In general most newspaper photos actually add little to the story.  However, it would be nice to have an occasional picture in my kindle.  Some of the charts or tables add a lot to a story and you miss some critical information without these. For Example, in a recent Kindle edition, an article ends with the words: ""The following is a look at some of the immigration proposals likely to grab headlines in the months ahead: "" If you have the print edition, there is an extensive table telling you what those are.  In the Kindle,.. nothing. Why?  Because that list is in a table and they didn't convert it.* I was glad to see that they had Movie Reviews in a separate section. However, it is a little misleading.  It seems that almost any article about celebrities or the entertainment industry ends up in the ""Movie Review"" section.  It should be renamed or the non-review articles placed elsewhere. I noticed that in the Sunday edition this section was called Arts and Entertainment, which seems more accurate.  I also wish they would publish movie show times.  I know that I can get these on the internet, but I'd still like to have them.* Some sections are not included such as comics, local obituaries, weather, classifieds, Calendar and ""Yes"" inserts.  I can live without most of these but I wish some of missing sections were included.  I'd really like to see a calendar of upcoming local events in the Kindle. Note: I'm not a big sports fan so I'm not sure how much of the sports section is included.* Some syndicated columns are not included.Summary:  When I saw that they had an edition of the Republic it was one of the factors that made me decide to buy a Kindle.  Overall it's implemented and formatted very well.  Price, to me, is an issue. Given that it's delivered electronically it costs the Republic nothing to add new Kindle subscribers.  I think price is the one thing that may discourage people from subscribing to the Kindle edition, or be willing to pay for both home delivery and Kindle. However,  I have decided to continue my Kindle edition.  It's a nice addition to my Kindle.Update (after 2 week trial)So far I have been pleased with my Kindle edition.  It's been on time every morning (at least by 5am).  There is an occassional glitch, such as an article that is missing the headline, but otherwise it has come across well.  Based on my experience I plan to continue on to a paid subscription and can recommend that you try it.Update after about  1  years:* The paper has been consistently delivered early each morning.  On the couple of occasions it was late, they sent a message to the Kindle stating it would be late.* For a few weeks the text was containing editor comments, such as ""leave next paragraph out.""  They must have been sending the first draft of articles to the Kindle.  It was actually kind of funny.  That has stopped.* As stated in my review what you get is a basic text dump of the articles.  No pictures, symbols, tables, charts, editorial cartoons, weather, etc.  I had thought that eventually they would improve on this, and like other Kindle papers start adding these.  No such luck.  This is very disappointing. With the Kindle's growth there should be large market for AZ Republic users.  However, many will not want to pay for a heavily stripped down version, for this rate.  Papers wonder why they are losing out to electronic media and the web, where everybody feels that everything should be free.  This is a great opportunity to offer an electronic version, and have paying customers.  They do not seem to be taking this it seriously.UPDATE: After subscribing to the Kindle edition for over two years, I finally canceled.  They quality just keeps getting worse and worse.  Front page ends up in the middle, Ann Landers is in the business section, screwed up formatting, comments like ""put headline here"" instead of the actual headline, and other problems every day.

And why repeat the much-anthologized ""Dracula's Guest"" and Benson's ""The Room in the Tower"" (both of which already appeared in previous Megapack anthologies)? If the editors had difficulty locating public domain vampire stories to include, there would seem to be a great many creepy ones from the ""Weird Tales"" (magazine) era which could have been considered. Repeating stories is not a wise thing to do because it runs the risk of alienating loyal customers of this product-line. But Wildside Press, to its credit, has repeated stories only infrequently, and it has also revised, improved and updated more than a few of its previously published Megapacks, so one cannot be too critical of an occasional blunder. Also on a positive note, this collection does include Gautier's creepy classic ""Clarimonde"" and enough solidly entertaining tales to make up for the few repeats and duds. So while this may not be as great as other Megapacks, it is still generally OK (and at only a dollar, still worth a try). Nevertheless, it remains disappointing because it COULD have been so much better.",269,A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,"ANEMIC  (Sorry, but I couldn't resist)",7,4.333333333333333,271,66.87,37.00,31.34,73.95,20.85,25.83,83.76,52.40,8.12,1.11,0.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.37,7.01,8.49,12.92,9.59,7.38,8.86,1.85,12.55,8.12,2.58,1.85,1.11,4.80,7.75,5.17,2.58,0.37,0.74,0.74,2.95,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.00,11.81,1.11,1.85,1.48,3.69,1.11,3.69,1.48,0.37,0.37,0.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.90,0.37,1.48,1.48,2.21,1.11,2.95,9.59,0.37,14.02,0.74,5.54,7.75,2.21,1.11,0.37,1.85,0.00,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.00,21.40,3.69,6.64,0.00,0.00,1.11,0.00,0.74,4.43,2.58,2.21,0.00

Protagonist Jake Martin (nickname Porky) is an unemployed software engineer and McDonalds regular who gets by on odd jobs, drinks an enormous amount of beer, and suffers from a shrinking bladder and  failing eyesight. He's generous, well-mannered, an aspiring novelist, and obviously smart--not exactly the hard-boiled sleuth one might expect in a mystery. He does not work alone. Always with him is Fred, his beloved golden retriever, the smartest dog since Lassie, who serves as a sort of assistant detective, early warning system, clue-finder, and ice-breaker.  Jake comes to his sister's aid as soon as learns she's in a jam, suspected of murdering her husband in a black widow insurance scam. In the course of his investigation Jake is stalked, run off the road, hospitalized, and loses his vehicle, money, and Visa card. The murder motive is connected with the Jesse James lost fortune myth. His investigative techniques include surveillance camera sabotage, illegal entry, computer hacking, and violation of federal laws concerning personal privacy. Jake's job is to put together all the pieces. The book is well written and edited, fully polished and professional. The dialogue is realistic and differentiated by character. Jake and Fred make a fine pair of detectives. No downers and much wry humor. Altogether, this is a fresh take on the mystery genre and a splendid novel.

The caracters seem to be described only by their bad habits and I don't find them in the least bit amusing. The main caracter is in his mid forties and it seems to be humorous to describe how he can't hold his bladder anymore because of his age. Really? At that young age? But then it could be because of his lifestyle, which involves a lot of alcohol, breakfast and dinner at McDonalds. The book almost seems to be sponsored by McDonalds.McDonalds food is also what he feeds his dog, and this is what I find the least funny, to read how in fact someone mistreats the dog that he supposedly loves.Everytime he goes to McDonalds he buys a couple of extra burgers, with cheese cause the more salt the better, to feed the dog. The fact that he's broke, makes this even more stupid. The sister didn't finish her meal, at said fast food joint, and yes it was fed to the dog.The one time so far he did make his own breakfast he burned a bagel, and, naturally, fed it to the dog.What's even worse, he's constantly giving the dog beer and his sister gave him wine!Then he goes out and leaves the dog in a hot car where it almost suffocates, as he also tells his sister later when he explains why he's leaving the motor running this time. This way the airco can stay on when he leaves the dog in the car as they go for fast food. Is this moronic behaviour supposed to make the 'hero' of the book more likeable or so?? It made me wonder if the writer has a dog that he treats the same way....Now I really like dogs, as you probably get by now, but why does it have to be in every scene? Not of any use to the story, not doing anything interesting or funny, yet his being there is described. It gets really boring.Well here my venting ends, I'll do my best to finish the book, but can't make any promises.....Here are some parts I highlighted throughout the book. Remember Fred is the dog.-I was working on my fourth or fifth beer. Fred was still on his first.-Fred pushed my hand holding the beer. He answered me with a sneeze after slopping up another puddle full of bubbles.-I poured more beer on the deck. It was a sure way to get Fred to stop bothering her.-""Oh?"" Megan asked while she scooped the eggs into Fred's bowl.( those were eggs she just burnt).-Fred loved the burnt French toast and sausage. ( more burnt breakfast).-I ordered four McDoubles and fries and went back to the motor home where Fred and I ate our gourmet meal.-""Guess I'll have to get off my butt, Fred, and see what's wrong with the house phone,"" I said and gave him the rest of my beer.-Fred, ( the dog!)even with a hangover, would have heard it much sooner than I could.Now the many times the writer writes about this throughout the story, made me indeed wonder whether it was based on his own experiences, and I just didn't see the fun of it.",546,AMO3DZA4HMUL6,A book I really don't look forward to finishing...,9,2.0,562,51.63,55.65,17.87,41.88,26.76,11.74,88.26,55.69,16.90,10.85,4.09,0.18,0.18,5.87,0.53,6.05,8.54,11.39,7.47,6.94,7.30,1.25,17.26,5.52,3.74,2.49,0.89,3.38,4.80,2.85,1.96,0.00,0.71,0.18,10.32,0.53,0.00,1.25,5.16,11.92,1.78,2.67,0.71,3.74,1.25,3.56,2.49,0.36,0.71,1.07,5.87,0.53,0.36,0.00,4.80,4.09,1.07,0.71,0.89,1.25,0.71,4.27,11.03,0.89,12.63,2.67,5.16,5.52,1.78,2.67,0.36,0.18,0.00,0.00,1.07,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.36,0.00,19.22,6.94,4.80,0.00,0.00,1.07,0.36,1.42,0.71,2.85,1.07,0.00

I find that type of categorizing almost as funny as the book itself!I'm quite sure many of the readers are adults for one thing...though, thanks to the magic of Kindle, I have been able to put a copy on my son's reader at the same time as my own, so we aren't tussling over who gets to read first (I won the race though, I finished first).The book has quite the appeal to both a 13 year old boy who loves all things cars, baseball, yo-yo and electronic, as well as the middle-aged scifi/urban fantasy/mystery (and cough-cough, romance) reading mother.  Definitely fits the 'Humor"" category and the 'spine-chilling' well, maybe in the drank-liquid-nitrogen sort of way---horror light.  Things happening, but not like a adult splatter-horror/on-screen  kind of way.It did take me longer to read than many of my more mainstream and (allegedly) adult books.  A large part of that is because the book actually makes you stop and think about the words.  The characters, even or most particularly the most minor ones,  make you stop and wonder more about them (exactly what does make one become an experimental bassoonist rather than a traditional one?).  The book is wry, witty, intelligent, and most certainly expects the reader to have a brain that functions--without regard to the age of the brain.How can you not love a book that has a character (named Bored Beulah) who notes ""Charlatans are a menace, whereas Loosten is an entirely different class of being:  an unholy terror.  There is a subtle difference"" ?  That one made me stop and share and even learn how to engage the highlight function on the Kindle.Oh, and as a Kindle/e-book being published by the author, don't let that scare you off.  If you are unsure, download a sample, but this book is better written, better edited and better formatted that MANY of the so-called 'professionally' published books.  In terms of length, no pages on my Kindle reader to give, but the locations is in the 5800-5900 range.

It's now available on Kindle for Android + 1 star (4 stars)2. Back issues ARE saved at Amazon. At least according to the subscription description on Amazon (click 'How Subscriptions Work' in the section where you can pay). What I can confirm is that the issues I was previously able to access are still available to me now that I've resubscribed. +1 star (5 stars)3. The formatting now allows access to the issue as printed, as well as a text only format (that does include a few pictures). This is a fantastic use of the technology, since the printed format isn't really a great option for onscreen reading.BUT - I can't seem to enlarge the pictures anymore. And access to some pictures (for example, the Step By Step pictures in the Sept 2013 issue), are only available in the print layout, not as separate pictures. You can zoom in on the page, but it's not the same as separately accessible pictures, and you can only zoom so much.- 1/2 star (4.5 stars)4. It is still not available on the Kindle PC edition. I would prefer this since I would be able to back up each issue to assure future access. Not to mention being able to view it on the PC. Granted, a backed up copy might only be viewable on the PC, but if they do disappear online for some reason, at least I would be able to retain access. -1/2 star (4 stars)I'm at 4 stars now. To be honest, I'm impressed with their Kindle offering and give them kudos for making it available. I'm also impressed that they are making it available on other e-zine platforms (Zinio for example).So, I will happily subscribe knowing that I can use it on most of my devices, and will have future access to back issues.My Original 3-star Review:I subscribed to this for my Android phone. I have received the April, May and June issues.The format worked well. The articles are separated into sections of both text and pictures. Like all native Kindle docs, the text is free-flowing. If you resize the font, the text adjusts for the size and orientation of the screen. This is a much better approach for digital reading than a simple pdf of the print magazine.I'm not sure of the resolution of the photos, but they were high enough for the phone.The issues are available early, I think when the print issue is shipped. So you get them right away.It appeared that the back issues remained in your archive for future use.So my rating for the digital edition itself is 4 stars.BUT - I can't get it any more. It now says it's available for only the Kindle Fire, iPad, and iPhone. The issues in my archive are gone, and it won't let me receive new issues anymore. The downloaded issues are on my old phone. This is a decision made by Kalmbach, not an Amazon or Kindle problem.So, before I'll be willing to subscribe again, I will need to know that it will be accessible on future devices, and that back issues won't be removed over time. I would expect the same access (forever) as the print issues that I always saved. With the DVD archive they recently released, along with a perpetual digital edition of future magazines I thought that Kalmbach was going in a great direction.

The first novel introduced Charlotte Silver, a teen girl who just wants to be normal, not an easy feat when she is the daughter of semi-famous paranormal investigators.  Raising the Dead begins soon after Past Midnight ends, in the midst of a torrential downpour.  The story drew me in from the moment it started, the meat of the story beginning almost immediately.  Purnhagen draws the reader in and doesn't let go of them, keeping them fully involved with the story to the end.  Although this was a fairly short novella, the story was told in completion without any feeling that any part of the story was rushed.  The author captures the voices of the different characters in her descriptions and dialogues and really allows you to feel as if you were a part of the story.

Unfortunately for many of those boys it also meant falling victim to a predatory priest.If we've been desensitized by all the attention given to the issue of sexual abuse by priests, David Margolick, succeeds in helping plant the topic back on the public agenda. ""A Predator Priest"" has force and impact because Margolick, a journalist who has written for ""Vanity Fair"" and was a reporter for the ""New York Times"" tells a compelling story that focuses on one priest and one family. The issue of predatory priests is abstract. Margolick tells a story that's squalid and all too real.For a half century until he simply became worn out and in ill health, the Rev. Bernard Bissonnette, ""Father Barney"" molested dozens of boys in the many parishes in Connecticut and New Mexico to which the Catholic Church assigned him in order to stay ahead of the repeated allegations of sexual abuse.One of those boys was Tommy Deary, one of 13 children of the deeply faithful Deary family of the sleepy mill town of Putnam, Conn. Described by his brothers and sisters as a trusting, vulnerable kid, Tommy at 13 was an altar boy at St. Mary's and was being repeatedly molested by Bissonnette.A victim, Deary was tormented with guilt and shame for 30 years, his brother Teddy said, ""His suffering didn't show. It's not like he had a limp. It was a pain that you couldn't see."" In September 1993 at age 43, he went into his garage, hooked up a hose to his car and asphyxiated himself.Three of his brothers set out to find a measure of justice. They succeeded in 2005 when the Vatican defrocked the old, infirm priest. The church described his offense in Latin, ""Delictum contra sextum eodem sexu: sexual misconduct with someone of the same sex.""That's only the shell of this painful yet remarkable story. Margolick has researched and documented a forceful account of abuse that strains credulity and serves as an indictment of the Catholic Church, which by turning a blind eye becomes complicit in decades of abuse involving an uncounted number of victims.[4.5 stars]",371,A1Q86V3UCYW0HV,"One priest, one family, decades of abuse and suffering",9,4.25,378,96.85,84.90,7.68,1.00,27.00,21.96,81.48,45.50,7.94,3.97,0.00,0.26,0.26,3.17,0.26,3.97,9.79,17.20,5.56,1.85,5.29,0.79,10.58,2.38,1.06,1.06,3.70,1.32,6.61,1.59,5.03,1.06,1.32,0.26,11.38,1.85,0.00,0.26,5.82,5.03,2.12,1.06,0.53,0.53,0.53,0.79,2.38,1.06,0.53,0.79,3.44,0.79,1.32,1.32,0.00,10.05,2.91,0.79,6.08,0.53,0.26,4.76,3.44,0.26,13.23,1.32,7.14,5.03,1.59,0.79,0.79,0.26,4.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.14,5.29,5.03,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.17,1.85,0.00,0.53

I review nearly everything I read, but I just didn't have any enthusiasm for this one, any drive to talk about it. The good news is that it's a cheap read, and so if the topic interests you then you won't be losing much in the gamble. Perhaps it's a matter of this story being all too familiar, and so the stark recitation of facts just doesn't seem like more than you'd get in a newspaper story. At this point, I don't need to be convinced that the Catholic Church, for all of its positive qualities, has allowed their children to be devastated while shuffling the abusers around and hiding them. Now, I want to make sense of it all.Father Bernard Bissonnette becomes more cliche than man as he pretty much hit every stereotype as he was allowed to abuse children for decades. A family seeks to confront him about it, and the beginning of the book promises this will happen. At the end we find out that he is pretty unrepentant, but so old and sickly that he is a pitiable figure. No one gets closure. The lack of closure for the reader is nothing compared to the lack of closure for these families. However, I'm left wondering what it all means and what the future seems to hold. Where is the context and how does this fit in with the bigger picture? Since the details, tragically, follow a familiar pattern, what does this piece offer?I've I'd read this story years ago, it perhaps would have been enough in it's current form. The tale is no longer a new one, and even as the details should be shocking they've become too familiar. What are the answers? How is the church apt to change to respond to this? We live in a time when the word ""priest"" is said, and people have to will themselves not to snicker -- even people who were raised Catholic.

Yes, molesting children is vile - espcially when done by an authority figure in the child's life - and it is morally reprehensible to protect pedophile under the mantle of the priesthood. But beyond that, I was content not to tell the Vatican how to run it's church as long as the church didn't try to tell me how to live my life.In David Margolick's Kindle Single A Predator Priest, the issue is brought front and center and presented not as something that takes a toll on the victims, the priesthood and the church. Margolick's work shows the very human toll priestly pedophilia exacts. On one side of the story is Tommy Deary, one of 13 children in a Catholic family. On the other is Fr. Bernard Bissonnette, who is inordinately fond of fishing trips with the teenage sons of his church members. On these trips (and at every opportunity) Bissonnette is fondling the boys and often moving beyound mere touching to oral and anal sex.Despite rumors of his behavior (this was the early '60s when priests were trusted unconditionally) Bissonnette's superiors moved him from one church to another, finally moving him from Connecticutt to Arizona. Throughout it all, Bissonnette continued to molest young boys ... homing in on the most vulnerable with an almost sixth sense. One of his victims before he left Connecticutt was Tommy Deary who suffered for years as the result of molestation at the hands of Bissonnette. It took Deary years to finally admit what had happened to him. By this time the molestation has already taken a toll on Tommy's relationships, family and even at times his sanity. It ended up taking his life, too, as he connected a hose to his car's exhaust and died in his garage clutching a Bible.To find peace and make sense of their brother's suicide, three of Tommy's brothers set out to find Bissonnette in Arizona. If they hoped to find remorse and repentence in the old priest, they were disappointed. Bissonnette remained defiant, claiming that Tommy (and presumably hundreds of others) seduced him. The victimizer attempted to play victim.This is not an easy work to read. Neither is it a work that allows the reader to sit passively on the sidelines. But it is a work that challenges authority and holds that authority responsible for what can only be called a great evil.",434,A38Q3T99Z5X2LX,Horrendous - but necessary - reporting,6,5.0,435,90.03,66.06,17.54,7.30,22.89,22.07,85.06,50.80,11.26,5.06,0.92,0.00,0.00,2.99,1.15,6.21,8.97,16.55,5.52,3.45,6.44,1.38,12.64,3.91,2.07,2.07,2.30,1.84,5.75,2.07,3.68,0.23,0.46,0.69,9.66,1.15,0.00,0.00,4.14,8.97,2.07,1.15,0.46,2.30,0.92,3.22,1.15,0.23,0.00,0.46,2.07,0.46,1.15,0.46,0.00,12.41,2.99,2.30,6.21,1.38,0.46,5.06,7.13,0.00,12.64,2.30,6.44,3.91,1.61,1.15,0.69,0.00,4.14,0.46,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,13.56,5.75,3.45,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.00,2.53,1.38,0.00

One of those few things is being molested by a member of the clergy as this article proves so clearly.As a boy, Tommy Deary was molested by a Catholic priest who early in his priesthood had his ""grooming"" techniques down to an art. He knew (usually) which boys would be the most easily victimized--and who would be the least likely to tell. When the molestation happened to Tommy, it was a completely different era, in that the word pedophile wasn't even used and certainly wasn't heard daily. The Catholic Church clearly knew this priest had issues, as we say today, but their method of dealing with the problem priest was to send him from town to town, rather than stip him of his collar.Tommy's suicide, though, changes everything. He never told anyone exactly what the priest did to him, though he told bits and pieces to several people over the years. Deeply troubled, Tommy committed suicide and the family believed Tommy's mental disturbances were directly due to the fact that he was molestated as a child.One brother, in particular, took on the mission of finding the priest and was determined to get answers about what really happened between the priest and Tommy. Two of his brothers went with him. They found the priest, but not one willing to tell the truth. He, in fact, actually blamed it on the victim, as is far too often the case. Eventually, the family pursues the matter long enough and hard enough that the priest is eventually stripped of his priesthood--something he would not give up, even though he was too old and sick to perform any priestly duties.No one can read this article without coming away feeling good that the family of the victim does have at least having some degree of satisfaction in knowing the priest was defrocked. I admire their courage and determination so much. It's just heartbreaking that Tommy himself was not still here when that happened, nor was he able to ever freely tell his story and heal.This is a very well written article about one victim out of many--just by this one priest alone--of the Catholic Church scandals of recent years. It shows the Catholic Church's tendencies to ignore priests with sexual problems and its denial that such things happened in the Church at all.What A Predator Priest does exceptionally well is to take all the priest scandal/molestation media hoopla and make it personal. This is one person and his family's story, yes, but it is representative of so many others, but in this one story I was able to connect with whole subject in a personal way that I hadn't been able to do before. The scandals have just been so huge, but this article boils it down to one person.While the article does not cast outright negative aspersions on the Church, it does show its reluctance to face up to the long-standing problems among its priests. Surprisingly, I was not as outraged as I thought I would be after reading this article. The Catholic Church has suffered, but its members have suffered as well, and they need the Church to regain its inner strength and restore its reputation. Much of what happened during this man's story was in such a totally different world that I think that other denominations would've reacted the same way. It's easy to forget in this era of over-telling everything there is to talk about that it hasn't been that many years ago when there wasn't even an adequate language to describe what was actually happening back then and even less education on how to deal with it effectively.The only thing that bothered me at all about this article is that I cannot help but wonder if this is what Tommy, who never completely told his story, would've wanted. He seemed to be a very private person in general, but that might have been because of the shame he felt. I can never know the answer, but I will continue to ask myself if this public telling of his story is what he would've wanted. I have to hope that it is.Overall, I was riveted by this article and am glad I read it. It's very well written and flows nicely. The length is perfect for a lunch break.

It's a good mix of light feature pieces (an entertaining profile of actor Pierce Brosnan was a good read) and long, detailed investigative articles (good one on the airline industry in the same issue).  You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.  If there's one criticism I have of Kindle blogs and magazines, it's visual sameness.  The New York Times looks like Newsweek which looks like The Philadelphia Inquirer, etc.  But Reader's Digest on the Kindle looks like, well... Reader's Digest.  You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.  I guess it's a small point (as content is really the most important thing), but it's nice seeing a Kindle magazine that looks truly different from other Kindle magazines.  With luck this will be the beginning of a trend.But, yeah, give an issue a shot.

I'm giving the Philadelphia Inquirer five stars not because it is perfect, but because it is better than all the other papers I've downloaded, all of the bestsellers included.  In other words, I'm grading on a curve.  There are some kindle related navigation issues which could be improved, but that is probably more of a factor of the kindle or the kindle's development software itself and less of a problem with the paper as explained below.The Kindle version of the Philadelphia Inquirer, in my opinion, is formatted better than either of the two mentioned above and the content is as good as or better than the NYT.  There are more pictures in the Inquirer as opposed to the NYT which, even given the Kindles graphical limitations, give the stories extra ""pop"".I don't much care for the local content of either the NYT or the PI, since I'm not a local in either of these metropolitan areas, but for when I want to read a newspaper on my Kindle I will choose the PI over the NYT until a version of my local Miami Herald becomes available.For local news, I'll have to resort to the Orlando Sentinel for now, even though the Kindle version's organization and formatting leaves much to be desired; that paper wouldn't get more than a two-three star rating from me, but that's another review altogether.As a final point, all Kindle newspapers I've downloaded have a clunky feel to the navigation of stories:  Articles list, Sections list, Front page and Location.  The articles list takes forever to page through because it shows the headline, author and a few sentences from the article.  The Sections list doesn't let you page through every article, just the ones in that section.  The ""Go to Location"" is completely useless since I still haven't figured out how the numbers work.  It would be nice if there was a ""headlines only"" list so you could see a longer list of stories to choose from, the Articles list mentioned above only holds two or three stories per page so I'm constantly paging forward and back to get to the stories that interest me.As a conclusion, let me just state that I find the Philadelphia Inquirer to offer the best combination of readability and content of the papers available for Kindle.  But don't just take my word for it; buy a single issue to try it out, these kindle single issue prices are inexpensive enough that you can try multiple papers before you decide on a regular!",460,AY8VDOCQFVMW6,Best Newspaper,2,5.0,456,85.83,24.82,54.71,67.23,45.60,20.83,80.48,53.95,10.09,5.26,4.39,0.00,0.88,0.00,0.00,4.82,11.40,15.57,8.11,4.82,7.68,1.75,12.06,7.46,5.26,0.88,1.75,4.82,3.07,2.63,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.22,4.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.35,3.29,1.75,1.75,2.19,1.75,5.92,1.10,0.88,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.48,0.00,1.97,1.97,2.41,0.22,1.10,9.87,0.44,9.87,0.66,6.80,3.07,2.85,0.00,0.00,0.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.60,3.07,4.82,0.22,0.44,0.00,0.22,0.22,1.32,3.29,0.00,0.00

Once I had it I knew that I would need to purchase a case. My goals for a case were simply to enable safe traveling of the device.I loved the case on my old Sony PRS-505, which is a simple folding leather cover; so I started with the official Kindle leather cover. A lot of the reviews referred to it damaging the Kindle DX screen, so I decided against it and kept searching. After looking at a lot of products, I decided to try this as it wasn't expensive and would fit my only requirement. One of the reviews referred to it as rubbing some of the blue off on the Kindle, but I haven't had this happen at all.The Kindle can fit a little tightly; making removing it from the sleeve a little awkward sometimes, but I actually like that. If it didn't fit tightly in the sleeve; it may slide out. I'd rather have a little harder time getting the Kindle out then picking pieces of my Kindle off the floor. That said, the Kindle slides in easily, and the case doesn't add a lot of dimension. The Kindle DX is big enough on its own, it does not need a huge cover making it bigger.To wrap up:1) Cheap.2) I like the soft/furry inside.3) I like that the Kindle fits well. (Not loose, but not overly tight)4) It can be a little difficult getting the Kindle out sometimes.5) I like the blue color.6) Doesn't add much additional dimension to the Kindle.Bottom line:It protects your kindle during travel; most importantly the screen.

When an army casts lead indiscriminately at a population, the underlying purpose is shock and awe, and the result is massacre. No amount of self-justifying verbiage - and there has been plenty of that - can minimize it. From the testimony provided by eyewitnesses and IDF combat soldiers, a massacre is exactly what happened. Followed by a blizzard of justifications, denial, obfuscation and outright lies, all of which Professor Finkelstein carefully documents. Amnesty International called the attack ""22 days of death and destruction."" The Israeli government called it justified.But this time they went too far. Operation Cast Lead was so far over the top and so overwhelming and indiscriminate (they even attacked UN installations) that they caused a tsunami of negative reaction from around the world. Their response? To build a political firewall of propaganda around themselves that had and has a very focused purpose: to seek out, delegitimize and destroy Israel's critics using every means possible, including character assassination, misinformation, intimidation and destruction of their resources and their organizations. This plan is outlined in detail in a report by Israel's Reut Institute published in February 2010 following a tsunami of negative response to the Gaza war. The report, which I have read and own a copy of, can be obtained, in PDF format, from reut-institute.org/data/uploads/PDFVer/20100310%20Delegitimacy%20Eng.pdf  It is well worth a careful read. An article by Ali Abunimah in the February 16, 2010 edition of The Electronic Intifada calls it ""Israel's new strategy: `sabotage' and `attack' the global justice movement.""Israel made it even more difficult for itself when, several weeks later it attacked the Mavi Marmara, one of the boats in a peace flotilla headed for Gaza, killing a number of the people on board. Again, the Israeli government justified it and launched a massive propaganda campaign of justification. But even the Reut Institute said they had gone too far.Israel is very good at being its own worst enemy. Instead of trying to partner with Palestine's indigenous Arab population and build a nation together, they set about vigorously uprooting and attacking them, a process that continues in both Gaza, the West Bank and within Israel itself. ""Under the guise of what is called the `peace process',"" Professor Finkelstein writes, ""Israel has effectively annexed wide swaths of the West Bank and shredded the social fabric of life there and in the Gaza Strip."" All, of course, justified whilst thumbing its collective nose at world opinion and the UN. Again, all carefully documented by Professor Finkelstein and others ... and justified and denied by the Israeli government.Israel justifies its behavior on the grounds of ""security"", but the question that arises in reading this and other books on the subject raises this significant question: Would Israel have any security problems had they treated Palestine's indigenous population as respected partners? Would they have any security problems today if they treated Palestinians with respect instead of contempt? I very much doubt it.""This Time We Went Too Far"" is a book that I recommend and have as part of my library. It is not, however, at all popular with those for whom Israel can do no wrong.

He wrote a meticulously researched book on Israel's invasion of Gaza in 2008.This new paperback edition is not only a revised but also a vastly expanded version of the hardback.The book is based on thousands of pages of human rights reports as well as testimonies of Israeli soldiers and statements of Israeli officials.It includes an analysis of all the official Israeli reports on the Gaza invasion right up until January 2011.It also contains the only analysis in any language of the Israeli Turkel Commission report on what happened on the Mavi Marmara.It is the only comprehensive study in any language of what happened in Gaza during and after the invasion.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Israeli/Palestinian conflictFinkelstein has been unjustly maligned by pro-Israel supporters. He was accused of being a Holocaust denier and of calling for the destruction of the state of Israel. Both accusation are false. And I'll explain why:Norman Finkelstein never questioned the Holocaust ie the mass extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany. His own parents survived the extermination camps but every member of his family on both sides was exterminated.He wrote a book titled the Holocaust Industry in which he criticized some Jewish organizations for exploiting the Holocaust to justify Israel's mistreatment of the Palestinians and for extorting Swiss banks and other governments and organizations. The late Raul Hillberg, the dean of Holocaust Studies, shared the the same views. Here's what he said to Amy Goodman on Democracy Now:""I was also struck by the fact that Finkelstein was being attacked over and over. And granted, his style is a little different from mine, but I was saying the same thing, and I had published my results in that three-volume work, published in 2003 by Yale University Press, and I did not hear from anybody a critical word about what I said, even though it was the same substantive conclusion that Finkelstein had offered.""Also Finkelstein never called for the destruction of Israel. Here's what respected Israeli historian Avi Shlaim says on p 369 of his bookIsrael and Palestine: Reappraisals, Revisions, Refutations:""Finkelstein is one of the most hard-hitting critics of the official Zionist version of the Arab-Israeli conflict. But while he uncompromisingly rejects the Zionist colonial project beyond the Green Line, he fully accepts Israel's legitimacy within its pre-1967 borders.""So contrary to what his detractors say Finkelstein is moderate in his conclusions. His style may be questioned but not his scholarship.For those interested in knowing more about Finkelstein, I recommend the excellent documentaryAmerican Radical: Trials of Norman Finkelstein",435,A1BWJYLTDHC89X,Meticulously Researched,2,5.0,455,89.03,57.84,13.95,33.35,37.92,30.77,78.02,48.79,10.55,5.49,2.20,0.00,0.00,3.30,0.00,5.05,9.23,15.16,5.27,4.84,5.93,1.10,9.67,2.86,1.98,1.98,1.76,1.98,3.08,1.76,1.32,0.00,1.10,0.22,8.13,0.44,0.00,0.00,3.30,9.01,2.64,0.88,0.00,2.20,1.10,2.86,2.86,1.10,1.32,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.27,0.88,0.66,3.74,0.00,0.00,4.40,4.18,0.44,10.11,0.00,7.69,2.42,7.25,1.32,0.22,0.44,0.88,1.76,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,12.09,4.62,2.64,1.10,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.32,0.88,1.32,0.00,0.22

PowersLovers of the old-style westerns will love Kid Wolf. He is a character not unlike the ones Johns Wayne played in the old Lone Star films from the 30's. An absolute and pure good guy. He is a ""soldier of misfohtune."" Traveling through the west; on the look-out for unfortunate victims; singing his favorite tunes about the Rio Grande(remember Singing Sandy from the Lone Star films); on his trusty and amazing steed Blizzard(""Blizzahd""); he saves lost wagon trains; recovers rustled cattle; outsmarts the lily-livered land grubbers; saves the stage coach from robbery and Indian attacks; and brings in the bad guys for the law.Kid Wolf complete with his heavy drawl, and white horse - who is also no stranger to saving the day - was one of author Powers popular characters from the more than 400 pulp-western stories he wrote for for magazines such as ""Wild West Weekly"" back in the the 1920's - 1940's. So in this book there are several different adventures for The Kid, and I got the feeling that each was printed on its own as a weekly story. So sometimes there would be some repetition. For example, Kid kept a hidden knife to save himself from his enemies/captors, and in each adventure, it was explained why, where and how he kept it hidden. Also there are some terms used that although probably pretty authentic of the way people spoke in the days of Kid Wolf and maybe most would not blink an eye at in the early 20th century, may actually be insulting to read - 'half-breed"", ""savages"". But for these couple of reasons, I would've gone 5 stars for the fabulous, and wonderfully written stories.The Kindle edition - Locations 2393. The first thing I noticed was the author on the title page is listed as Ward M. Stevens.This was a pseudonym of Powers. Other than some spacing problems(sometimes, more often in the last half, only a couple of words on a line then it jumps to the next line) and a few typos, I found the text to be nearly perfect.

Suffice it to say, if you're looking for that kind of commentary, I won't be providing it here.Instead, I'll just say that having Instapundit on Kindle is really a magnificent convenience, akin to having an RSS feed.If you're like me, a very active reader of blogs and a newly enthusiastic Kindle owner, this $1.99 p/m purchase goes a long way.Even if you have Whispernet on intermittently, due to Glenn Reynold's all-day blogging, you will always know his latest topic without opening up the ""Experimental/Basic Web"" browser.(The web browser, however, allows you to view his blog in both its normal content and low-resolution PDA format; very handy if you're on a budget -- but if you are, your last purchase should have been the still pricey Kindle)Speaking of lo-res, unlike many other bloggers, his site still has a Web 1.0 look to it, which those of us who remember the days of Lynx might enjoy.This is hardly a knock. Like Google, its uniformly clean lines and simple intros to each post are a delight to read.Glenn is a self-confessed Heinleinian Libertarian, and this has prompted some commenters to put him into the right-side of the Blogosphere. In truth, he's a moderate and his posts are free from that batty jargon which the internet propagates so easily.His gentle, dignified tone, and trademarked catch-phrases (like the 'heh' mentioned in the other review) are endearing and indeed, self-mocking. Reynold's seems to be aware of his impact on the Blogosphere, which is immense, without actually losing his self-possession about it.Lastly, his range of topics is unbelievably catholic. You almost could forego reading a whole newspaper, just by reading his updated posts.Truly, you can't go wrong with having Instapundit on your Kindle.Of all the 14-day free trials I've added, from Le Monde to the Independent to Jossip (I'm not immune to a little gossip, as it turns out)......Instapundit is the only one I know I'm keeping, for sure.",350,A27PSQ4HY3UTDI,The Joy Of Instapundit Convenience,5,5.0,369,67.63,73.34,15.48,71.55,61.50,17.62,81.30,51.76,14.63,8.40,1.90,0.27,2.98,3.25,0.00,6.23,7.59,13.55,9.21,5.42,4.61,1.36,14.63,3.25,1.63,1.63,1.08,2.17,5.69,4.07,1.63,0.00,0.27,0.54,10.84,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.25,11.11,1.90,0.54,1.90,3.25,1.90,4.61,2.17,0.81,1.08,0.27,0.54,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.27,3.79,0.81,0.27,1.90,0.54,0.54,0.81,9.76,1.08,11.65,2.17,5.96,3.25,1.63,1.63,0.00,2.17,0.54,0.00,0.54,0.00,0.27,0.27,0.00,0.00,24.66,5.96,7.86,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,3.52,0.54,4.07,1.63,0.81

There is a separate post for titles in a particular genre.  So if you're looking for thriller novels, they're all together.  Erotica?  All together.  Romance?  Yep, all there for you.As another reviewer said, I don't understand what all the complaints are about, either.  Why are people complaining about the book selection?  The blogger has no control over what books are available for free on any given day.  Why blame him? To try it for a day or two and assume that there is ""only"" a certain type of book listed on there is a little strange.  It's not like the guy can say ""hey, there's no thrillers today, so I guess I'll just make up some fake thriller titles.""  My first day on the blog, I found cook books, parenting books, history books, religious fiction, thrillers, erotica, romance, and some mostly boring-looking non-fiction books.  That's just a brief sampling.  There were literally a hundred books that day, maybe even over two hundred.  Maybe some of these reviewers just checked the blog on slow days?  I'm not disparaging their opinions or experiences, just merely pointing out that I definitely have had a good experience on the blog, and found some great books, including some freebie books on writing, so perhaps they needed to give it more of a chance.I found a bunch of books on the blog that were in genres I'm interested in, but never think to do a search for.  But when you see the blog title, you think ""oh hey, I haven't read one of those in a while"" and you can often find something good.

Also, the PC is an architecture which runs a variety of operating systems like Linux, BSD, Windows, etc. In this magazine they concentrate only on Windows/Mac.

B005XD5144,Kindle Store,"[30, 30]",3.0,1.0,4.098039215686274,5.0,"If you're a fan of Maximum PC, and want to move up a notch (in my opinion), subscribe to the Nook Color or Kindle Fire digital version. I'd been a reader of the magazine in print for several years, but my subscription lapsed about a month before I got a Kindle Fire. Now, I'm glad because I find the Kindle version even more useful than the print version.The ""native"" mode presents the pages in ""page view,"" which is essentially a full-color reproduction of the printed pages of the magazine. Every page is included - even the ads. Since Maximum PC is one of the few publications where even the ads can be pretty educational, that's a good thing. However, on the Kindle Fire's 7-inch screen, the pages are pretty hard to read. You can use the traditional two-finger ""pinch zoom"" gesture to zoom them up to a readable size and then pan around the magnified page. Double-tapping on any page zooms into it. Double-tapping again toggles back to the original view. This works, but can be tedious. Swiping to a new page returns the magazine to the ""fit-to-window"" size. Even when you immediately go back to a previous page which you had magnified, it no longer will be.That's where ""Text View"" is a lifesaver. Tapping on any page brings up the menu that allows switching between Page View and Text View. Text View shows the text and pictures from the articles, but independently of the magazine page's layout. The text is the same basic size used with books (and can be changed in the same manner as with books). In this mode, the ""pinch-zoom"" gesture does not work - just as it doesn't work with books. For text that's fine, but images sometimes need to be zoomed in to read. Clicking on an image will open in on a separate page. Rotating the page will re-size the picture, too. So rotating a picture that more wide than tall will make it bigger; double-tapping it onto its own page makes it larger still. Best of all, the separate image page can be zoomed in using the pinch-zoom gesture. Clicking on the X in the upper right of the picture page closes it and returns the reader to the spot of the picture in the article. I expect that ""Text View"" doesn't just happen automatically from the ""Page View"" source, so for whatever effort is required, I thank the writers and publishers. Text View isn't available for the ads, so to see those, you need to be in Page View.I still like viewing some of the content in Page View. For one thing, the menu mode in Page View shows thumbnails of all the pages, which can be used to swipe left and right through the magazine quickly. There is a slider along the bottom as well. The thumbnail view makes it quick to skip to an article again, and they are large enough to tell what's on the page. I found myself switching between the two views often, so it's good that is so easy to do.There is one thing that could make the digital version even more useful for me. The magazine needs better hyperlink, twitter and email integration. Many of the articles include bit.ly-shortened URLs at the end, and/or an email address and/or a twitter handle. None of those can be selected and opened in any simple matter. The most useful to me would be the URLs. If I long-press on a word, the word is highlighted. For bit.ly URLs, typically the whole URL is chosen (including the ending period though, which could be problematic). Letting up on the selection presents a pop-up menu with a definition (if available) and options to Search (bringing up hits within the magazine), open the term in Wikipedia or open the term in a Google search. Sadly, opening the text as a URL in my browser of choice isn't there. I don't know how hard it would be to add this, but guys (and gals) from Maximum PC, if you are reading this, please, please, please try.

Forced to make a heartbreaking decision, Olivia fights against injustice wherever she finds it. Never conventional, she sets up a business renting rooms in a boarding house in Detroit. But OK Accommodation is far more than what it appears to be and Olivia never flinches from the danger she continually puts herself in, as she helps runaway slaves escape to the safety of a new life in neighbouring Canada.Through everything she endures, Olivia clings to one shining hope. (I&#8217;m not telling you what it is. You&#8217;ll have to read the book and find out!) She is one feisty lady and the author&#8217;s writing is such that you live this story with her. You suffer with her, cry with her, laugh and rejoice with her. The author is a natural born storyteller and I was sorry to finish the last page.Yael Politis has become one of my favourite authors. She first hooked me with her amazing story of struggle, hope and tragedy in the Middle East during the Palestinian Mandate &#8211; &#8216;The Lonely Tree&#8217;. For this new series, she has returned to her Michigan roots and turned out a wonderfully atmospheric ongoing story of a remarkable woman, battling prejudice, bigotry, fear and discrimination in 19th century America.

Since this is a novella going beyond that would give too much away. I will underline that the main character is a teenager, so I'm assuming this is a start to a YA series. But that didn't detract from me enjoying it as an adult and I thought the teenagers were well-drawn. Not hokey or ridiculous like many teens are portrayed.My Soul to Lose is really short and is billed as a prequel. So it really only gives a taste to whet your appetite and set the stage. Some people might find that brevity irritating, because no explanations for anything are given. You discover as the story goes along, but don't get any answers about What or Why.

The cover gives off a bit of a creepy vibe and I wanted to know the story behind it. I've been really into YA books lately that feature teens with powers such as mind-reading (a power which Bridget, the protagonist of this book, has) so that had me intrigued. Something about the book felt a bit off to me though and it didn't really live up to my expectations of it.I had a tough time really getting into the story. Perhaps the writing just didn't suit me personally, but my head was swimming from it for about the first thirty percent! I just found that it was quite difficult to tell who was saying what. Someone would say something but the sentence immediately following it on the same line would be about another character. This caused me to do a lot of double takes though it did improve as the book went on. Some sentences seemed to be missing words as well which would pull me out of the story.I enjoyed a lot of things about it though! The idea of the powers the characters had really interested me and I loved learning more about them. The book is certainly full of mystery and the suspense certainly kept me on my toes. The story kept me rushing forward to see what would happen next and how each issue would be solved. We meet lots of interesting characters and not all of them are who they appear to be at first glance!While flawed, Thoughtless still managed to keep me interested and I enjoyed the unique storyline and how believable Bridget was as a character.

The process for selecting the image and creating your perfect cover is fairly painless:Step 1: Decide whether you want the image on the front, back, or both. If you select both front & back, it has to be the same image for both; you can't put a different image on each.Step 2: Select your image. Amazon has 9 ""Exclusives"" images, all of them various patterns, plus 30 other pattern images and 30 nature scenes. You can also browse your computer for an image you have taken or created.The one drawback to the latter is that it has to be a pretty large image. If, like me, all of your personal images have been resized for, e.g., display on Facebook, you'll find that they are too small for this process. The dialog notes, ""We recommend using an image greater than 1 MB, and for best results a 2500 X 3500px or higher resolution photo shot in portrait mode."" I tried it with an image that was 513 pixels high by 408 pixels wide and it was ridiculously small in the preview mode, even at maximum magnification, covering only a postage-stamp area of the case. There are options to zoom, move, and rotate your personal image but there is a limit to how much you can zoom and there is no option to tile an image.The dialog that walks you through the process has a good preview that shows you what the image will look like on the case and I had fun playing around with various options. Ultimately, I opted for a nature scene, autumn trees reflected in a pond. The image in the preview was sharp and clear, with vibrant colors; the image on the case I received in the mail less so. The colors were muted and the image not as sharp. It was still attractive but you should definitely be aware that what you see is not exactly what you will get.Step 3: Add to Cart.That's basically it. Because the image has to be attached to the case, this case won't be available in two days, even if you have Amazon Prime. In my case, it took a little over a week.As for the case itself, it's the standard Amazon Polyurethane Origami Case. The origami notion was a clever idea and it's fun to play with but I'm not totally sold on it. The case is a bit heavier than I expected, since it has a magnet to keep the case closed, magnets to lock in the origami mode when the case is open and you're using it as a stand, and magnets to hold the underside of the tablet to the case. It made me a little nervous that the tablet didn't lock into the case, as is typical of most cases but, so far, the magnets are holding the case securely in place and I've not seen any sign of slippage or any chance that it will fall out of the case.Naturally, the case supports automatically turning the tablet on when you open the case and off when you close it. Some users have reported problems with the cover folded all the way back that the tablet gets fooled by the magnets and it thinks the case is closed so it shuts down. Personally, I haven't seen this.In origami mode, the case can prop up the tablet either in landscape mode or in portrait mode. The one thing missing is that with the older generation cases, you could prop the tablet up at various angles. With the origami case, there's only one angle, although that angle appears to have been reasonably well-chosen.Overall, I give the case 3 stars. I'm taking away a star because the image quality isn't what the preview showed and because they require such a large image for personal pictures, and another star because the origami case has some quirks that take getting used to. On balance, I think I have a slight preference for the simplicity of the previous-generation cases.Update: Amazon customer 22twain, in a reply to my review of the 7"" case, had a couple of great comments that I think are worth repeating. Quoting his comments:I don't do the Facebooks thing, but there is something to be said about non-destructive photo editing. As a general rule, before editing any of my personal photos, I make a copy of the originals at the native resolution and save off elsewhere in order to prevent accidental modification.Regarding the muted colors and image clarity, that's the difference between looking at an image on-screen (RGB) and the printed equivalent based on a pigment (CMYK) process. If you choose to use your own image(s), bump up the contrast, brightness and/or saturation in a photo editing program first. I use Adobe Photoshop to ""tweak"" my colors before sending to print, but pre-installed software on your PC/MAC can tackle the basics.",832,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,Clever origami case but image quality not quite what's shown in preview **Updated**,13,3.3333333333333335,853,83.82,52.34,32.57,54.46,30.46,16.53,78.90,52.75,11.61,6.10,2.58,0.12,2.93,0.12,0.35,5.51,11.49,13.36,8.21,3.63,6.80,1.29,12.90,5.51,3.05,1.06,1.99,2.81,3.52,2.23,0.70,0.12,0.23,0.12,5.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.12,10.67,1.52,2.11,1.17,2.93,0.94,3.87,6.10,5.39,0.12,0.59,0.23,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.12,4.34,0.23,0.70,1.64,1.64,0.35,2.93,9.14,0.70,11.61,1.41,8.09,2.46,1.17,0.70,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.00,15.83,4.81,5.63,0.70,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.70,0.82,1.88,0.70,0.35

But from past experience, some of the online editions that one finds here can be not only annoying in their formatting, but quite substandard, to put it mildly.Luckily for us, this digital edition of Outdoor Photographer doesn't suffer from some of these problems.Outdoor Photography Magazine isn't just about great outdoor photos, but there are enough of them to satisfy, that's for sure. Just taking the recent July 2012 issue, you find Scott Mansfield's b&w; image of ""Yosemite Valley and Clouds"" along with his ""Muir Woods"" and Jon Cornforth's large full-color capture ""Denali Sheep"" shows up quite well here. There are many more to be found, in both b&w; and in full color, and in most cases the photographers list the gear that they used along with good commentary.Rob Sheppard's how-to article ""Organization Will Set You Free!"" offers excellent basic organization techniques to help you find, sort and catalog your images on your computer, which has been a challenge for many, and his photos and images help illustrate this, with ideas that work with Adobe Photoshop Elements Organizer, Adobe Bridge, Apple Aperture and a variety of dedicated filing programs.You'll find equipment sections along with product reviews, and the columns that we're used to in the printed-paper editions are here, along with the editorials. There are features and helpful how-to articles throughout.It should be noted that this digital publication is not set up for the legacy Kindle devices; as noted in the little drop-down on the product page, this one is only available for the Kindle Fire and the Kindle for iPad (Version 2.9 or later) as of this date. For those who are looking for other monthly digital photo editions that work well with the Kindle Fire, check outShutterbug, as it's proven to be a good one.One thing worthy of note: if you find the heavy use of ads to be a distraction, look for the Menu icon on the bottom middle of the Kindle Fire's screen. By tapping on this icon, you'll see the choice between Page View (the default) and Text View. Tapping on Text View allows you to read all of the articles without the proliferation of advertising... yet all of the photos are still there, and in glorious color when they appear in the magazine that way. Just imagine if you had an editorial assistant who took scissors to the advertisements and just cut them all out, leaving you with all of the text and images.Bottom line is that this Kindle edition ofOutdoor Photographeris easily worth a 5-star recommendation, and this is one with which you can enjoy all of the photos, editorials, how-to articles and product reviews the way you like. And don't forget that a subscription to the Kindle Fire edition of Outdoor Photographer comes with a 14-day free trial, so you have a chance to review it and see. Try it and you'll see what I mean.7/31/2012",533,AEJAGHLC675A7,Outdoor Photographer: Excellent on the Kindle Fire,7,4.444444444444445,553,84.13,69.37,7.36,76.01,42.54,18.99,81.19,49.91,11.03,4.88,0.54,0.36,2.71,0.36,0.90,6.15,7.78,15.73,6.51,4.34,7.05,1.08,12.12,5.24,2.17,1.63,2.17,2.35,4.34,3.44,0.72,0.00,0.18,0.18,6.15,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.36,10.13,2.53,1.81,0.90,2.53,1.27,2.53,6.87,5.97,0.00,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.88,1.08,0.90,1.99,1.08,0.18,2.35,8.68,0.72,7.96,0.72,5.42,1.81,5.24,0.90,0.00,0.54,0.00,0.00,0.72,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,17.00,3.62,5.61,0.18,0.54,0.00,0.18,1.45,1.45,2.53,0.72,0.72

I thought at first that most should be pretty equal in quality but was seriously mistaken.Living in Los Angeles, I ended up choosing and keeping the Los Angeles Times subscription for it's coverage of California news and Calendar section. However, I noticed a (very) significant difference in quality from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times to the Los Angeles Times. The aforementioned newspapers rarely (almost never) have typos or grammatical symbols in their articles. The articles are nicely formatted and are very consistent. This is not the case with the Los Angeles Times. While the information is pretty much there for the Los Angeles times, it is very evident that there is a lack of quality in the Kindle edition. I want to like it and the articles are very relevant to me as resident of Los Angeles. The Kindle edition is maybe 80% there.The editors of the LA Times need to put in more work into this Kindle edition to bring it more in line with their competition. Please look at the quality of the New York times and Wall Street Journal and try to match it (no typos, add pictures and charts, no formatting errors, etc). I'm still a subscriber to the Los Angeles Times but I have seriously pondered switching to either the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal simply for the quality of both their articles and the quality of their Kindle editions (the only thing keeping me as an LA Times subscriber is the California section and the Calendar section in the newspaper). Hopefully the editors can put in the required effort to make this a quality publication.

Well, years later, the finally jumped on the Kindle wave.First, the formatting for Kindle wasn't done very well. I hate that there are so many categories in the ""section list."" Often, each section only had 2 or 3 stories. Consolidate! I also hate how each article starts out. Instead of giving a title and jumping right into the content, each article includes a 1 or 2 sentence summary of the article. Add that to the authors name and other tid-bits and its 8 or more lines down before the actual article starts.Second, and most importantly, the content isn't that great. As The Oregonian has fired staff over the years, they have started including more and more content from wire services. I read the Wall Street Journal and New York Times every day...I don't need to also get a few of their stories, plus AP content via The Oregonian. What I do want is the local stuff that the big guys can't do. However, The O only has a business section 4 or 5 times a week these days.

My wife just recently upgraded from a Kindle to a Nook (so she could download library books). I got her hand-me-down Kindle 2.We've been Oregonian free for a couple of months (the price had gone up and we wanted a break for the summer). I missed reading the Newspaper so I decided to give the Kindle version of Oregonian a chance. The first thing to say is that boy is this convenient. I grab my Kindle as I head out to work and the Oregonian is ready to read.The digital download does seem fairly close to the actual paper version (minus the advertising). It's easy to navigate and has the photos you'd expect. So if you are interested in reading just the news then you should appreciate the electronic version.However, what is glaring to me is what's absent. You won't find the following:* Comics* Weather* Individual Stock Information* Movie listings* Classifieds* Ads/CouponsThe absence of comics and weather might be a deal killer for me (that's what I went to first when reading the paper version). I'll give it another week or two before I decide.Pros:* Convenience* It's never late, wet or lost.* No papers to recycle (which I guess makes this a greener solution)Cons:* It's Abridged* It's harder to share than a newspaper* It contains a surprising number of formatting errors and typos (mostly missing spaces or unexpected line breaks).The price is less than advertised home delivery subscription. However, this is the first time I've paid full price for any Oregonian subscription. I always paid the ""intro price"" because I always cancel the paper when the cost went up (they always call after cancelation to offer the ""intro price"" again).  Also since the Kindle version has no advertising (which means no coupons) it's hard to take advantage of the cost savings that provides (it doesn't take too many $10 off Safeway coupons to pay for a paper). Because of this, I find it hard to justify the Kindle version as being alot less expensive.Is the Kindle version a good value? Maybe. It just depends on what convenience is worth to you and whether you can live without the missing sections.Update:Sept 30, 2010 version has a glitch were all of the articles are truncated - meaning they stop mid sentence long before the article is over. Hopefully this is a one time glitch. So, I'd add to the cons list, that the Oregonian appears to be still working through the technical details of ePublishing.Update: Jan 2011I've read the Kindle version of the Oregonian for about 4 months and have decided to cancel my subscription (at least for awhile). It turns out that with the current Oregonian promotions it's cheaper to have the Oregonian delivered. We also found ourselves buying the Sunday paper because of coupons which takes the Kindle version out of the running for being cheaper. But the final straw was that I couldn't put the subscription onto the iPad that is jointly used at our house. I can move books around to different devices (including the iPad), but it appears that newspaper subscriptions can only be sent to a Kindle device.When the current promotion runs out I may start up the subscription again, but I think the Oregonian should consider allowing the subscription to work on the Kindle software on an iPad and consider a electronic plus Sunday physical delievery subscription option.Update: Jan 2012I bought myself a Kindle Fire in November, so I tried the Oregonian again (because Amazon allowed me another 14-day free trial). I definitely like reading the Oregonian much better on the Kindle Fire than the older Kindle. But the Oregonian still has most of the drawbacks that caused me to discontinue it before. It seems like every day there is a garbled article or two. I find that very disappointing since they've had a year or more to work out these funky formatting issues. I also leave for work about 5:30AM and the Oregonian is delivered electronically after that. I don't have Wi-Fi access for my Kindle Fire at work(my Fire refuses to work on Wi-Fi w/a proxy that requires you to login) which means I can't read the Oregonian on my Fire until I get home. My older Kindle had 3G so this wasn't an issue. Granted this isn't an Oregonian issue, but it does mean that I can't read the Oregonian in the morning. Given all of that, I've discontinued the Oregonian again. Personally, I think other local web sites (like KATU) offer similar quality local news free. That makes it hard for me to justify an electronic subscription to the Oregonian.",775,AW4GC20Q3F1ZA,"Should be called ""The Abridged Oregonian""",6,3.0,794,75.24,27.28,68.72,46.67,24.06,20.28,81.49,51.64,14.11,7.56,5.42,0.63,0.88,0.25,0.38,6.55,10.08,13.10,8.31,4.53,5.54,1.64,15.99,4.91,3.40,1.51,1.64,2.02,2.64,1.89,0.76,0.00,0.13,0.63,3.78,0.13,0.00,0.38,0.13,12.34,2.77,2.02,1.01,3.02,1.01,4.28,2.02,0.38,0.13,1.51,0.50,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.00,5.54,0.88,2.14,1.26,1.64,0.13,3.27,11.34,0.88,12.72,1.76,4.28,6.55,3.53,0.76,0.38,3.02,0.00,0.13,0.13,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.76,5.42,1.64,0.88,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.76,0.50,3.15,3.53,1.76

I can read 19th-century English very well, thank you, but this isn't 19th-century English. It's more like a stew of ancient and modern, and is difficult to comprehend without constantly looking up terms--terms that aren't in a dictionary. I'm not sure why Purves did this, except to give flavor to the words. I would suggest getting a translation that is completely in more modern English. The stories stand on their own, without (what seems to me) artifice.But that isn't the worst of this edition. I know enough German that by reading aloud, I can understand the Germanic words. The worst is the way the text is formatted. In their opening notes, the formatters state that they took Purves' notes and put the glosses in the margin, flush right, and the longer notes at the end of each section. Nuh-uh. The glosses are NOT right justified, and are simply run onto the ends of the lines. If the definition is longer than the page is wide, it wraps either under the line or onto the end of the next line. This makes it extremely difficult to know where the poem leaves off and the notes begin.Having the longer notes at the end of each section would be acceptable IF they were accessible by clicking on the numbers interspersed rather jarringly throughout the text. They aren't, and without an active table of contents, it is impossible to refer to the notes and back to your place again easily. In fact, there isn't even a button to go to the Table of Contents; one has to go to the beginning and page through.I would so love to be able to move easily between the Prologue, which is Chaucer's summary of each character, and the tale each one tells, and to be able to refer quickly to the notes that explain some of the places and professions.",342,A1B3WULA4M1KYU,Very difficult to read,4,2.0,351,87.67,24.69,72.02,52.49,23.40,17.95,80.91,54.70,9.69,4.56,2.56,0.00,0.57,0.00,1.42,5.13,11.68,15.38,8.55,4.27,5.70,3.13,14.53,5.41,3.42,1.14,1.14,2.85,3.70,2.56,1.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.11,3.99,1.14,2.28,1.99,1.14,5.41,0.85,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.27,0.28,0.57,0.57,1.71,1.14,1.42,10.83,0.00,14.81,1.99,8.55,4.84,0.85,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.57,0.00,16.24,5.41,5.13,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.00,1.71,0.00,2.85,0.57,0.00

It's lightweight, undemanding reading that's just good fun after a hard day (they call themselves ""PopSci"" for a reason - it's like pop music but for science topics - fun but contains little real substance), and I've subscribed to it for many years. I recently purchased a Kindle Fire so that I could read this and some other magazines (as well as other materials) during my long daily train commute without having to lug around the paper copies.  Here's where I'm having some cognitive dissonance: An annual subscription to the paper version is a mere paltry $7. Great deal! The Kindle version is $1.99 an issue, or nearly $24 per year. This bears repeating - $7 for a year's worth of physical copies made of physical paper from physical trees (or wherever physical), physically mailed to my physical mailbox by a physical mail carrier via physical trucks, airplanes, cars, whatever - with physical mailing costs included, whereas the electronic version (no mailing, no trees, no physical anything) costs three and one half times that - for a string of electrons that costs virtually nothing to shoot over to my (digital) door. What am I missing here? It sounds like it's specifically designed to abuse people who want cool electronic versions of stuff just for the sake of having cool electronic versions of stuff, and Amazon/Popular Science has decided to capitalize on that - to the extreme. I like cool digital stuff just like the next guy. And although I actually PREFER the paper versions of magazines, I thought it might be a little more convenient (and cool) to travel with electrons vs. physical paper - and I'm certainly willing to pay a modest surcharge for the convenience of doing so (the key word here is ""modest""). Well, not THAT much I'm not. I really like the basic functionality of the Kindle Fire and its potential, and certainly liked its very reasonable purchase price when compared to similar products out there.  I've read that Amazon is selling them at a loss with the intent of making it back through content sales and I basically don't have a problem with that. It's good marketing. But am I alone thinking that this is a bit (read: a LOT) over the top?  Maybe it's just me, but . . . this strikes me as just plain nuts! So, while I have been known to do nutty stuff, I'm not THIS nutty. Unfortunately, it seems I will have to continue to do my part to furthering the logging and paper industries and subsidizing the U.S. Postal Service. I can find no sane reason to go the digital route on this product. I give 4 stars for the magazine in general; 1 star for the truly absurdly abusive pricing of this digital version.

I developed diabetic neuropathy of my fingers last year. Then I read the doctors' book about truly controlling diabetes.In summation, Dr. Bernstein argues that traditional medicine teaches that diabetics (I am type 1, using insulin) must avoid 'sugar'. Dr. Bernstein states that the real culprit is carbohydrates (carbs), not just 'sugar'. This magazine may be good for the 'mild' diabetic, but I cannot recommend it for anyone else.I cancelled within the 14 day limit.I followed his advise about limiting my total carbs to 18 grams, or less, per day. After a couple of months, my diabetic neuropathy was gone. My insulin requirements have gone down.So! I ordered this magazine on a 'trial' basis on my Kindle Fire. I went to the 'lemon deserts' part. Each recipe stated that it had 16 to 36 carbs per portion. The people of Diabetic Living do not consider white flour (for instance) a 'carb'.The magazine also advertised as rating the best 'non sugar' substitutes. It was mainly an advertisement for popular sugar substitutes found in any grocery store ((I will note name them) but ignored some of the fantastic substitutes you can find elsewhere (such as &#34;Just like Sugar&#34;, made of Chicory Root, and which I highly recommend).As I learn more about diabetes and carbs, I am appalled (as was Dr. Bernstein) that so many 'reputable' magazines (and government agencies) neglect to talk about 'carbs' and believe that simply substituting some 'non sugar' substitute for 'sugar' will help the diabetic.I hate, of course, never again being able to have 'carbs', such as potatoes, white bread, etc..However, I do like having my fingers back.",305,AY54QSGO3KWEM,Not Diabetic Friendly!,3,4.5,322,60.52,26.73,38.54,36.71,26.83,22.05,77.02,45.03,13.35,8.70,7.76,0.00,0.31,0.31,0.31,4.66,5.28,11.49,6.83,6.21,5.90,1.24,12.11,4.04,3.11,0.31,2.80,3.11,4.35,2.48,1.86,0.31,0.62,0.31,5.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,10.25,2.17,2.17,0.31,2.17,1.24,2.80,3.11,0.62,0.00,1.24,7.14,0.62,4.35,0.00,2.17,4.35,0.62,1.24,2.48,0.62,0.31,3.42,6.52,1.24,7.14,1.24,2.80,3.42,3.73,2.17,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.00,28.57,8.07,5.59,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.00,8.07,4.66,1.24

Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper, this is detracting, disrupts the flow of reading the paper, and is pointless.

Unfortunately few of these do justice to the actual publication, which stands out as being remarkable among journalism.A few things about the Kindle edition which people seem to forget.  There is no paper, nothing to throw away, and conversely there aren't 30 pages of advertisements to offset their costs (of which they have tons beyond printing and delivery).  On top of that, browsing the Kindle is vastly faster, once you get used to the UI, and it is easier to absorb almost twice the news content in the same time alloted.  The Kindle version is a lot like the HBO of news papers, you get great content, but you're going to compensate them for the fact you aren't using basic cable with adverts every 8 minutes...  I also think the photos are all there, but I haven't really done a page-by-page comparison to figure that out.  No color, but the Kindle can't do color, then again the WSJ didn't have color until 2005 or so (last of the major hold-out papers to avoid the switch).Another thing important to note about the WSJ is Dow Jones themselves.  They have a *huge* news organization, which in the face of universal cutbacks elsewhere is becoming even more noted for their solid reporting.  When you get a Dow product, you're buying original news right from the source.Local papers are a dime a dozen, and they all source the Associated Press.  It doesn't matter which local you select (pick a random city, go for the cheapest), and on any given day that paper will match, word for word, 75% of whatever happens to be in your local (most sports except high-school is even AP sourced).  Even our local media outlets share reporters between radio, TV, and print.  Dow doesn't do this, and they don't wire their stories out for broad inclusion in other papers.  I'm sure it's partly corporate ego, but they have a justifiable reputation, so more power to them.Am I saying I enjoy paying $15/mo for a paper?  No, I wish it were free.  But at the same time I recognize that the WSJ has always been one of the most expensive papers in the country.  Even in a down economy their ""new subscriber offers"" are at least double what you can negotiate out of a local.  They've also been one of the only papers in the world to be growing their subscription base.  Another problem...  Kindle owners are also early-adopters.  They know this.  You wouldn't own one if you could only afford used books.  It might sound, well capitalist, but I'm pretty certain they realized that $180/yr was something they could collect from a bunch of rabid-reading-fanatics who love a $300 reader (we sort of collectively set ourselves up for that one I think).  I do however feel sorry for college students (since e-book readers are eventually going to replace everything I'd guess), since a low-priced student subscription would have been a kind gesture.A couple other things.  I have been a print WSJ subscriber for years, and got rid of it...  My day became too busy.  It was hard to carve at least 60 minutes with traditional news print when I'm trying to fit everything else in.  The Kindle really took care of that.  Not only can I find what I need, faster, but I can grab the Kindle from the night stand, read the top stories, before my coffee pot goes off.  Plus I don't know how much time I actually wasted looking at the front-page, and then figuring our which sub-sections I needed to jump to for the apparent article...  All not a problem on Kindle.Mind you, I'll admit that I think the Internet is killing journalism.  People have started to expect free...  And when you remove all profit from a paper, the quality is going to suffer.  For whatever reason, people don't make this connection.  They run to Google news, and then comment incessantly in forums that the quality of the product is poor, but at the same time no one is helping offset costs.  And then you end up with a situation where you always hear the same thing...  If you leave yourself only the AP for news, you'll have whatever bias they bring to the table, and it will be inescapable without other voices (especially since I've heard cable news read AP copy verbatim that I read off the Internet only hours before).Now for the bad things.  They don't include comprehensive ticker numbers on the prior day.  It makes sense, if you have a Kindle I'm guessing everyone who subscribes also uses a finance site for real-time data, but I tend to be a long-term investor.  I check my mutuals infrequently, and being able to save a portfolio on the device would be really helpful.  Not sure if that's really Amazon's software problem, or the WSJ subscription.They have two annoying indexes.  They include the typical ""What's News"", front page index...  Which is easily one of the best features of the print publication for saving time.  However it's redundant on the Kindle.  The Kindle already gives me a very concise, nice, topical, section index.  But now I've got ""What's News"" polluting the virtual cover with links in addition to the standard functionality which is already quick and clean.  I really wish I could shut-off the double-view.  However, this is a big personal choice.  Originally the Kindle version didn't have ""What's News"" and long-time readers were fuming...  You can see their responses in the older comments. ""What's news isn't there, I can't find anything!"" (etc).  The problem being is that you can, but you couldn't treat the print and Kindle version in the same idiom, you had to use the Kindle navigation.  They made a lot of people happy by putting it back.Also, I think you need to make sure your personal information with Amazon is correct.  It seems that I get a lot of articles that come out of local Dow Jones offices.  As a result, the Kindle WSJ seems to have a healthy amount of Nor Cal stories (but then again SF is an economic hub so those local stories might actually be national).  I suspect if I bought a true ""national"" edition, some of those stories would be missing from the print copy.  Or likewise if my Amazon billing address were off, I wonder if I'd be getting useless regional news from the wrong geographic area.  If you subscribe, and have odd relevance problems, I'd check there (maybe you need to correct your auto-pay address data, cancel the sub, and resubscribe, I don't know but some people have mentioned content issues which I don't seem to have.  Maybe they use an out-of-state business credit card or something).You also don't get the full WSJ-online feel.  If you're so wired into the markets you *need* hour-by-hour updates, then you'll be left behind.  Perhaps they do mid-day updates, but I've never noticed because my recent daily routine has been to block out ""news time"" and then give it a rest until the next day.  Although I admit that's just my style, and trying to keep productive in ever smaller amounts of time.And finally, a big plus.  No celebrity news.  Seriously.  I don't care what young actress had what problems, or what sports star might have been cheating on whom.  Unless it has legitimate news exposure (like broken endorsements costing major firms billions of revenue), I don't care.  Dow has always been good for figuring out ""what's news"" and just leaving it at that.  Even if I don't like one of their stories, I at least respect the fact it's probably meaningful for someone in a totally different line of work.Oh, and for those of you that like the op-eds, they seem to be all there.  Generally I'm a centrist, so I like the hard articles best, but there are very few outlets for intelligent conservative commentary these days.  Most bloggers just throw fireballs and insult people, but the WSJ and NYT have managed to keep above that.  I'm glad to see that tradition continues on the Kindle.  It's nice to read it first, and then later hear about the ""controversial op-ed"" on the Sunday talk shows.Bottom line:  Is it expensive compared to other Kindle news offerings?  Yes.  Is it also better than the other papers?  Yes.  Can you get the WSJ cheaper if you go on-line or new-subscribe print option?  Yes (however their renewals are rarely kind, unless you wait them out to start begging, which is inevitable.  You'll need to go without any paper for about 90 days before they typically offer the same deal -- first renewal offer was about $199 last it hit me while still a print subscriber).  Is the Kindle version worth .25 cents more per day than the cheapest rate?  Yes, considering I can read twice as much news in the same amount of time.",1575,AROUNU2BJ18IO,The WSJ the way it should be....,7,5.0,1538,54.49,48.18,58.16,47.41,19.23,16.32,84.40,53.19,14.50,8.39,3.71,0.26,2.41,0.00,2.02,6.11,7.74,12.35,10.14,5.53,6.57,2.28,16.84,5.79,3.12,2.02,1.82,2.67,4.29,2.67,1.50,0.07,0.33,0.33,7.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.43,2.41,1.69,2.28,3.71,1.82,4.88,1.56,0.59,0.52,0.39,0.20,0.07,0.00,0.00,0.07,4.75,0.65,0.78,2.02,1.17,0.59,2.54,12.35,1.56,13.52,1.50,6.31,5.92,3.19,0.72,0.13,2.21,0.00,0.07,0.52,0.00,0.13,0.26,0.13,0.00,21.07,6.70,5.01,0.07,0.00,0.33,0.07,1.89,1.17,3.58,1.56,0.72

In addition, I far prefer scanning articles in the Kindle format versus rustling through the physical paper.-> Content: I'm subscribing for a reason, I enjoy reading this paper.  The editorials and front page summary of ""What's News"" are great.Cons:-> Pricing: Others have beaten the issue to death, and I agree. At the current price of $14.99 / year, it just doesn't make sense.  I'm considering going with the online version instead and using a product like Calibre to manually move online content to my Kindle in the morning.  It's definitely not as easy as getting the Kindle version automatically, but I just can't justify the current price.  I suspect that the pricing is what it is because the WSJ's advertisers get zero exposure in the Kindle addition.  Result: the price has to be increased to push consumers to other (advertising-subsidized) versions of the paper.-> Sharing content:  This is a big limitation.  Yes I can tweet my comments/excerpts or put them on Facebook, but that's not what I want to do.  What I want to do is read an article (that I paid for) and share it with people who I know will be interested.  The Kindle version doesn't allow this, and for me, it is a serious limitation.Other thoughts: I too would like to see the WSJ come up with a combination subscription that includes online + Kindle (or physical paper + Kindle);  basically, include the Kindle version as a cheaper add-on upgrade to another subscription.  I'd pay slightly more for access to the Kindle version on top of the online version and then would have the best of both worlds.

The best solution so far is to make sure that there are sufficient hyperlinks for notes, table of contents and anything else one might want to temporarily refer to. The separate Article List and Section Lists can do a pretty good job of this if implemented intelligently.The WSJ ""Whats News"" listings used to be on Kindle as a separate section, with its own article list that included the first line of an article and each article was hyperlinked. There were duplicate listings of articles under the various section headings, but so what? You could easily find what interested you to read first.Now the ""What's News"" listings are all under ""Page One"", with the articles listed in a hard to read series as a single paragraph (a bulleted list would at least be some improvement), with no hyperlinks for the individual articles.Then THAT Page One ""paragraph"" is hyperlinked to where you finally get the original individual article hyperlinks from a headline cum first line listing. This means more clicking, more levels to find what you want. A very counter productive time consuming change. An ""improvement"" it's not.Bad idea No. 2: The reduction of sections listed in the Kindle ""Section List"" - my preferred default state rather than the article list - no longer includes a ""Letters and Opinion"" Section. Instead the letters and Editorials and Op-Eds are just at the end of the huge continuous ""Page One"" section listing, so you have to page through the whole Page One list to get to the editorial content.This change is another time-consuming annoyance that also suggests that the new regime at the WSJ doen't understand the basic concept of journalism that ""news/facts/reportage"" and ""editorial/opinon"" content are not the same thing. The old system made it clear what was what, which gave the reader some confidence that the owners, editors and reporters also were clear on the distinction. Bad move, WSJ.I also second the complaints about the cost: they could at least throw in the web subscription for the price of the Kindle edition, although I do use the WSJ mobile web version with the Kindle browser to get the market data page.Along with the NYTimes, the WSJ is still one of the better Kindle periodical implementations, but it could have been improved; instead we got the opposite.",464,ASSYZSM1U4XLP,Nov 2008 format change not good = 4 stars now not 5,12,3.230769230769231,475,86.84,41.67,22.27,57.62,39.58,22.74,77.47,48.63,9.47,2.53,1.05,0.21,1.05,0.00,0.21,6.95,11.79,11.37,7.58,4.42,5.26,1.26,12.21,4.63,2.53,1.89,2.95,4.00,3.79,2.74,1.05,0.00,0.00,0.21,2.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.42,1.89,1.89,2.53,2.32,1.47,4.00,0.84,0.42,0.21,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,5.68,0.21,2.32,1.89,1.68,0.63,3.16,8.21,0.84,12.00,1.26,6.74,4.21,3.58,0.21,0.00,0.84,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.00,4.00,3.37,0.42,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.84,4.21,0.84,1.26,0.63

At $9.99/month, I was already paying a bit more for the Kindle subscription than my $110 print+online subscription had cost me, but it didn't seem too bad: a little less content, a little more convenience, basically a wash.  I'm unhappy in principle with the DRM (and would never, ever buy a Kindle book from Amazon for that reason alone) but in the case of a newspaper subscription it's barely tolerable; again, the physical equivalent of the paper would be going into the trash at the end of the day anyway.A sudden price increase of FIFTY PERCENT for an unchanged product, however, seems unjustified to me.  Obviously the cost of delivering the WSJ to the Kindle hasn't just gone up $5/month.  I'm sure this is just playing around with the demand curve, but in my case it's pretty elastic.  I can read the WSJ at work - it's a little less convenient than browsing it on my Kindle in the subway, but not $5/month less convenient.  Accordingly, I will be canceling in two renewal periods when the price for existing customers goes up, unless Amazon/WSJ retract this increase and keep the existing price.What with this, and the sudden increase of wireless document delivery from 10 cents per document to 15 cents per rounded-up megabyte (a huge increase if you send large documents!) I'm liking my Kindle a lot less nowadays (and no longer recommending it enthusiastically to everyone I meet).  The reasonable 10cents/document fee and the relatively reasonable $9.95/month WSJ subscription fee were major factors in my purchasing the Kindle.  I doubt I would have bought it two months ago if the WSJ had been $15 or the per document fee had been 15 cents/megabyte.  I don't like Amazon changing the terms so radically now that I'm locked in to an expensive device.

I like the format of Print version as I see the headlines and information in an organized way, which let me absorb information much faster and easier.  Kindle edition uses the two columns format (one category and one titles) and I really have the similar feeling as I read a print version.  With Kindle, my hands are clean,I don't need to take the whole pile of paper to read, and I don't need to make space to pile up papers. This version has What's News, pictures and graphs that Kindle version didn't provide before (if you read reviews written in 2007 or even 2009).Compared with Digital Plus version. I can be concentrated when I read the Kindle version, and get headline much faster and easier compared with online or WSJ app versions with which you don't really have any emphasis,just hop here and there and get lost.  Digital Plus version is like any other news websites, and not WSJ, the newspaper. Kindle apps format is more friendly to me than WSJ apps. But I still have the access to the online version with this subscription, and WSJ apps and online provides newly updated articles. With this version, I can read through Kindle app and WSJ app on my phone and Android pad, and enjoy pros of both versions.Basically I pay $2 more per month to get a nicely organized version of WSJ on top of the searchable and most updated information from Digitla Plus version.  It is to me not just about a nice looking format, it is about a format that I can read more and get more out of the subscription.I highly recommend this version.A small point, I spent one hour to figure out how to link my Amazon account to my WSJ account in order to get online and WSJ app access after I paid through amazon.

B000FDJ0FS,Kindle Store,"[12, 12]",3.0,1.0,2.5436363636363635,2.0,"I was a very loyal and long-term subscriber to the WSJ.  Years ago I started out with Print edition, but then noticed that the ""teaser"" rate, tripled over the years, and they automatically also started adding charges for the online edition; which I didn't recall ever subscribing too.  Then for years I switched to the iPhone application to save some money, which was OK, but really small screen and font was not ideal for reading - the price at the time was only $79 a year.Then I made the switch to an Samsung S3 Android, and transferred my subscription.  As is always the case with WSJ subscriptions, once you are loyal subscriber they quickly increase the price.  I also found that Dow Jones really likes to mess with their WSJ Mobile applications, and for a while they had two available on Android. i.e. The WSJ Reader (which was a spartan application with limited functionality and took forever to download the articles), and the much more mature WSJ App which was full features, allowing you to press a single button to download all the articles and even save items of interest.  For some strange reason the folks over at the WSJ killed the more robust WSJ App and now you only have a single choice of using the ""reader"" application with limited functionality.Which finally brings me full circle to considering the WSJ Kindle application, until I read the caveat that ""Pricing Controlled by Publisher.""  So, based on my previous experience and the fact that this subscription started out around $120 a year initially, based on some historic review; and is currently at $275.88 per / year.  I'm going to presume that's a temporary price.I recall from my studies in Calculus that there is always an optimal price, often derived from the second derivative.  It seems the clowns (sales & marketing folks) over at Dow Jones are always trying to push the envelope on pricing to maximize profitability vs. customer loss.  What they seem to forget is that there are also ""substitute goods"" and ""cost of acquisition.""So, here's a little financial lesson, from a former long-term customer.  Stop raising your prices ever year, especially on loyal customers, or they will find other financial periodicals which are as good, if not better, especially in the time of free financial blogs and other news alternatives which I recently discovered call ""USA TODAY"" - which is FREE and allows for a simple download of all the current articles in a single button and has informative news alerts.Lastly, it is FAR MORE EXPENSIVE TO GET A NEW CUSTOMER THAN RETAIN AN EXISTING CUSTOMER.  Raising your prices every year and putting out crappy applications, and then removing access to good applications kills GOOD WILL.  Take a look at Verizon's model, they were smart enough to allow all their customers on ""unlimited"" cellular service plans to continue with the same pricing and service; provided they supplied the new hardware.  Verizon didn't force all their existing loyal customers onto a new and more expensive plan, and I'm guessing they maintained or grew their subscriber base.  BTW, Verizon does retain the right to change the existing pricing plans, but CHOOSES NOT TO.  I'm going to speculate that the WSJ has a difficult retaining customers, which is why they are industry leaders in teaser rates and bait and switch marketing techniques.It's sad that the readers of the WSJ must educate the employees in the Dow Jones sales and marketing department on the economic lessons which they should have known already.

The kindle version is crippled compared to the print edition as very few photos and graphs are included.  They made it better some number of months ago, but it still lags considerably.3. Both the print and online editions are richer in content--with the online VASTLY richer with more articles.  However, I do not like reading on the computer screen, so the kindle made sense.4. being able to search the wsj for keywords on the kindle was great.5. I really enjoyed not having the piles of paper around the house.6. The pricing didn't make sense at 9.99 (but it was tolerable), and now it makes less sense at 14.99 which brings it over the cost of the print version. How can something sent wirelessly cost more than actually printing and having someone drive it to my house each day?In my opinion, Amazon is really dropping the ball with their Kindle vision.  It's a great vision and a compelling device, but the content is still too crippled and expensive.  The WSJ is an example.  I recently bought a kindle book which was only $1 cheaper than Amazon's new hardcopy price (and more expensive than a used book).

When I'm interrupted, for example when switching from a train to a subway, I put the Kindle in screen saver mode.

I'm also currently a print version subscriber, but not an WSJ Online subscriber.  I agree with a previous reviewer that this is a good but not great product.  Here's what's good:- Ready for me to read every morning, and I don't have to go outside to get it.- Includes articles from the Online version at the end.  I've not seen anyone comment on this.  This is nice, and allows news that breaks after the paper goes to press to be added to the download.- Easier to read (no fighting with the paper itself)- Hands stay clean- Searchable- At $120 per year, this is a good value vs. the print version at $250 per year.  And I don't think comparisons to the cost of WSJ online are valid.  The kindle version can go with you and be read anywhere, just like the paper version.  The online version cannot.- No adsHere's what I need to see to call it great (are you reading this WSJ?):- The What's News section.  NO IDEA why this is not included now. Makes no sense.  No pictures - that I understand.  But why the What's News section is not included is beyond me.- I want every article to have a small lead-in after the headline like what is included with the articles found on page one of every section.  This gives me some idea of what the article is about because the article headline is not always descriptive enough.  Even if you just give me the first sentence...  With the paper version you can quickly scan the the first few sentences to see if this is an article of interest.  Can't do this with the way the current kindle version of the paper is produced.- I do miss the the pictures, althought the famous WSJ line drawing head shots are included.  Would like to see some pictures eventually.Ultimately, I think I will convert to the kindle edition.

It is also ""new"" in the passion and enthusiasm that Blessed John Paul II has stated is essential for its success, along with an openness to the Holy Spirit to show us new methods and expressions of the faith that can communicate with people today.""But why do we need the new evangelization? Well, the answer is simple: in many areas of the world, particularly the global north, the Church is shriveling. As Ralph shows, baptisms, mass attendance, marriages, and funerals are down across the board. Christian culture has collapsed in many countries that were historically Catholic. And despite large numbers of Hispanic immigrants steadying the American Catholic population, the future in our country looks bleak as young Catholics disavow their faith at record numbers.According to Ralph, there are two major reasons for this shrinkage. They include a ""catastrophic collapse in catechetics,"" to borrow a phrase from Pope Benedict XVI, and a general disbelief in hell. Citing the work of sociologist Christian Smith, Ralph notes that the religious beliefs of most young people today can be described as ""moralistic therapeutic deism""--a fancy way of saying they conceive of God as a distant Santa-Claus-in-the-sky, concerned only with rules and regulations and positive self-esteem. This profound misunderstanding of who God is, itself a catechetical failure, is a main reason so many fail to know and love Him.The other reason Ralph gives for the Church's diminishing evangelization is a general dismissal of hell. This, according to Ralph, is rooted in a misinterpretation of paragraph 16 in Vatican II's Lumen Gentium which reads:""Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience--those too may achieve eternal salvation.""Many Catholics read that and think, ""well if people can be saved without hearing the Gospel, why evangelize them?"" That conclusion is sad and common, and provokes a generally tepid response to evangelization.(For more on this problem, check out Ralph's newly-released book titled,Will Many Be Saved?: What Vatican II Actually Teaches and Its Implications for the New Evangelization(Eerdmans, paperback, 336 pages). The book is based on his doctoral thesis and examines the views of luminaries like Hans Urs von Balthasar, Karl Rahner, and John Paul II.)But here's the good news: there is a solution. Despite the dire statistics, despite the crumbling Catholic foundation, the ""new evangelization"" is a powerful antidote. Ralph shows how the Holy Spirit is using this movement to revive the Church and how all people are invited to join in--priests, religious, and laypeople alike.If you want an expert understanding of the ""new evangelization,"" along with practical tips on how to live it out, this short, $0.99 eBook is the best one-stop-shop.

What is most important to me is that the product, once installed, worked very well.  No bubbles, smooth to the finger and good anti-glare with a resulting screen that was clean and clear rather than distorted as some ""anti-glare"" screen protectors produce by scattering the light randomly.That said, i think they need to work on the installation instructions.  The very tiny letters with small images simply isn't helpful, and since i've not seen this kind of install before, it was a little perplexing.  Once i grasped the process i began to appreciate it because the result came out well, but it really did take a while to figure it out.  Also, gluing the cloth to the back of a piece of cardboard meant that i didn't find it until after i had completed the install.So, i'm very happy with the result even if the road there was a bit rocky - hence the 4 star rating.

One downside is the interior is like a felt cloth and black in color, which is already showing stains and collecting dust. I can only imagine what this sucker will look like a year from now. The leather does make the Kindle look like an ordinary book and until opened, you would likely never know a Kindle was enclosed.

B002QDBU4Y,Kindle Store,"[35, 36]",3.0,0.9444444444444444,4.5,3.0,"I've had this case for about a week, and I am still impressed with the feel of the leather.  Soft,rich, supple, luxurious, beautiful... all can be used to describe the quality of the case.  The case construction is also top notch - the Kindle-specific hinge works perfectly and the stitching is flawless.  The front cover folds back easily, allowing for comfortable one-handed handling.But even after the many superlatives used to describe the case, I am still left wrestling with a few problems.  I had previously been using the black Amazon-branded hard Leather Cover and had become accustomed to the magnets that both secured the Kindle flush to the back cover, as well as kept the front cover securely fastened when closed.  The Octo Vintage case does not include magnets, or any method keeping the cover securely closed.  This is not so much a problem with the back flap; not only is the leather soft enough to fold without putting stress on the Kindle-specific hinge (this was a problem with the rigid black Amazon-branded case: folding back the back flap could crack the Kindle), but the Kindle can be securely fastened to the back cover by a thin strip of material on the inside bottom right corner of the case.  However, the front flap does not have a method to keep is securely closed, and the soft supple leather spine allows the front cover to sort of ""twist"" clockwise and counter-clockwise.  I don't know if that explanation makes sense, but the front flap never feels secure and moves easily.Also, handling the case while it is closed causes the five-way joystick to depress.  If you pick up the closed case by the right side, you can noticeably feel the joystick being pushed down.  The joystick sticks up a bit - it's easily the tallest facet on the face of the Kindle - so I can understand why the cover is pressing down on it, but I never experienced this with the black Amazon case and it's an unsettling feeling.  What if I forget to put to sleep or turn off my Kindle?  Carrying it around will cause the five-way control to be depressed several times and I'm a little uncomfortable thinking about what might happen.  All that would be needed to rectify this would be a small square depression built into the inside of the front cover to take the joystick's height into account.Overall, extremely handsome case that could be perfect if a) the front cover had a way to be securely fastened to the Kindle, and b) the five-way control be taken into account in the design of the case.  Those are the only two quibbles I had with the case, but they are big enough for me to deduct one star for each.  Add a small square depression for the five-way control, and add any way of securing the front cover - I noticed previous versions of this cover had leather laces that allowed the case to be fastened shut - and this easily becomes a five-star product.",523,A27HPMIDEQ5LBL,"Beautiful case with supple leather, but not without faults",9,3.0,518,89.30,26.84,49.00,75.85,30.47,17.57,82.82,50.77,6.95,3.09,2.51,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.19,3.86,13.51,12.16,9.46,4.83,5.98,1.54,14.48,5.02,1.16,0.77,1.54,2.51,6.95,4.83,2.12,0.77,0.00,0.77,0.77,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.13,2.51,3.09,2.32,2.32,1.74,3.28,4.25,1.16,0.00,2.70,0.58,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.56,0.00,0.58,3.09,1.16,2.12,3.28,10.42,0.39,14.86,1.35,11.00,3.67,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.19,0.00,13.90,4.05,3.86,0.19,0.19,0.19,0.00,3.09,0.39,1.16,0.77,0.00
B002QDBU4Y,Kindle Store,"[11, 11]",3.0,1.0,4.5,5.0,"Bought the Kindle DX and the Octo cover at the same time and have had both about a week now. I am very pleased with both and would recommend each without reservation. The excellent reviews for the Octo product convinced me to take a chance even though the price is not low - well you get what you pay for and I've always liked quality - and the Octo cover is quality. As other reviewers mention the feel and appearance of the cover is rich and luxurious - I like that it is a bit retro looking. The brown is very attractive and with the jet black felt-like inner fabric it sets off and compliments the white Kindle nicely. Quality stitching and attention to detail. Perfect fit over the Kindle.The cover does fold back on itself for one-hand reading and so far the leather seems like it will take this kind of stress - it is supple. Time will tell. The cover is a bit heavy but that is okay - I wanted quality and a means to protect the Kindle and the screen from pressure. The cover is nicely stiff over the screen to afford protection. Not so heavy that it is a burden to hold.The mount clamps/release mechanism for attaching to the Kindle work flawlessly and once used to them it is a simple matter to take the Kindle off and put it on the cover - 5 to 10 seconds. There is a black elastic strap, also easy to put on and take off, on the lower right corner to prevent the back cover from flopping away from the Kindle and stressing the mounting hardware and possibly causing a stress fracture of the Kindle or screen. There is no clasp or strap to keep the Octo closed but that is not a problem for me and would rather not have something that would just get in the way.One reviewer mentioned the black felt inner lining as a negative and felt it would get dirty and soiled over time. I see the black felt liner as a positive for several reasons. It is very attractive and it shows lint and dirt specs easily and lets one know it is time to clean off stuff that can transfer to the Kindle screen. In a former life I wore a dark blue police uniform and used to use a couple loops of 2"" masking tape around my fingers to pat down the uniform before duty to remove lint and foreign matter. I do the same thing with the black felt on the Octo- use clear desk tape wrapped around my fingers to pat the inner cover and remove dirt specs and lint - comes out looking like new. Caution, do not use duct tape or masking tape - this has too much adhesive and you will probably end up lifting the felt off the liner - use simple clear desk tape that is not overly adhesive.Another thing I use for the Kindle and screen (that can be bought at any camera store) is ""Kimtech Kimwipes""Kimtech Science KimWipes Delicate Task Wipers; 4.4 x 8.4 in. (11.2 x 21.3cm); 1-plyand ROR (Residual Oil Remover) ([...]) in a small spray bottle that is used for cleaning sensitive camera lenses and microscopes. Great for the Kindle and screen - removes all dirt, grime, fingerprints, dust, lint, etc.Another reviewer mentioned that the 5-way controller button for the Kindle protrudes above the plane of the Kindle face and this is true. When the Octo cover is shut you can feel the cover clicking down on the button and releasing. It is pretty irritating and even though I always put the Kindle to sleep before closing the cover who knows what this constant pressing and releasing of the controller button will do. The suggestion was that Octo provide a small square cutout of the leather inner pocket so the controller button can recess without having pressure applied. This is an excellent suggestion so I did it myself with an Exacta pointed knife - cut out a  inch square of the inner leather pocket so the controller button can seat without making contact. It works fine and there is no longer any pressure on the button when the cover is closed. Does it look a little funky - yes, but not too bad - it is in an area that no one will see (except you) and it takes care of an annoying problem. If you do this make sure to slip a piece of thin cardboard into the pocket behind the flap so you can cut without puncturing the outer flap. The leather is thick and it is unlikely you will even go through the felt inner liner - I did not.All in all a very good product. Another plus is you can attach a portable mini-light to the Octo and not to the Kindle (which might damage it).",823,A1W3TQ94U9480M,Good Looking Quality Cover for the Kindle DX - One Fixable Problem,12,5.0,820,82.24,37.55,26.97,41.19,27.33,14.51,80.73,51.34,9.39,3.29,1.95,0.12,1.10,0.00,0.12,6.10,11.34,11.95,7.80,4.02,7.56,2.07,13.66,5.00,1.59,0.73,1.71,2.07,5.00,2.93,2.07,0.85,0.12,0.24,2.68,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.00,10.61,1.95,2.20,1.10,1.83,1.46,3.05,6.10,3.29,0.12,2.56,1.10,0.85,0.24,0.00,0.00,5.24,0.24,0.49,2.07,1.59,0.85,2.44,10.12,0.85,11.46,1.46,7.80,2.44,2.07,0.00,0.00,0.73,0.00,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.12,0.00,10.73,4.63,1.10,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.00,2.44,0.37,0.12,1.46,0.37

Loosely, indeed! The film script is about as close to the text as Pinocchio is to Moby Dick. Hey, there were whales in both! I've reviewed the film already, so let's turn the pages of the standard translation.""White Nights"" is a first-person narrative of four nights in the dismal life of a man whom the 19th C might have regarded as a ""melancholy dreamer"" -- that's what he calls himself -- but whom the 21st C would tersely diagnose as pathologically depressed and probably bi-polar. Unlike the film, the novella is entirely focused on the man and his state of mind, his unfathomable anomie and loneliness. The first-person narrator is so awkward that he narrates his own hapless life in third-person. One night, as he trudges the back streets of St Petersburg, he comes upon a young woman standing on a bridge, crying. Despite his morbid dread of encounters with other humans, he finds himself eager to speak to this attractive stranger, and a chance mishap brings them into conversation. Of course he falls into a euphoria that he supposes to be Love ... and that's all I dare tell of the plot, isn't it?I hardly know whether to declare that this story is a psychological masterpiece or else a piece of maudlin drivel.

Here's an updated (downgraded) review of the Kindle product, based on an email I sent to The Atlantic.The Kindle edition of this excellent magazine is marred by numerous conversion errors.  For example, here are the errors I detected in a single read through just one of the articles (William Powers' dispatch on body surfing in Liberia) in the July/August 2012 issue:The subtitle for this article was mispunctuated and miscapitalized, with a period rather than a comma after the first clause.  Elsewhere in the article, ""one"" was substituted where ""once"" was clearly intended.  A whole line of text was missing: these sentences ""The first gigantic wave slammed me into a sandbar. I limped back to the beach and lay on my back in the sand"" appeared as ""The first gigantic limped back to the beach and lay on my back in the sand"" on my Kindle.  That's a lot of mistakes to catch in a casual perusal of only 1085 words, and it marred the experience of reading a well-written, intriguing dispatch.There are many other, similar errors in this current issue, along with most other Kindle editions of The Atlantic.  I don't think it's too much to expect that Amazon's document conversions be checked for accuracy before being released to paying subscribers.

Meanwhile, our government has kept secret clinic-specific data that could help patients make better decisions (Medicare agreed to release them after this article), and the two corporate chains dominating the system (DaVita, Fresnius) together earn about $2 billion in operating profits/year.

Consequences are seldom meaningful - just 16 clinics were closed from 2000 to 2008.Italy spends about one-third less than the U.S., and only about 11% die each year, vs. 20% in the U.S. Patients have more than 5X as much contact with their physicians as in the U.S. Patients start dialysis sooner than in the U.S.The 'good news' is that Medicare is now moving to improve dialysis care.""Your Child Left Behind"" reports on a study by Hanushek that compares individual American states with foreign countries, looking at 15-year-old students ranked as the best at math in each location.

Demi's struggles are so raw and emotional and Chrissie handles them and the issues brought up in this book so well.Demi starts going to a school for the deaf, and she meets other students, and we get a glimpse into their struggles. There are some who sign and speak, some who can read lips, some who can't, some who are non-verbal. As Demi got to know them better, so did I. Keisha was one of my favorite secondary characters. She is so bright and bubbly, and brings a neat perspective to the story.As for Demi, I cannot imagine what it would be like to have hearing and then all of the sudden be plunged into a world without sound. But I do get an idea because of this story. Demi worked through some of her issues on her own, some with the help of her new friends, and some of them through her old friends.Ethan is the love interest in this book, and he amazes me. He never made Demi's deafness and issue, and approached it with maturity that made me respect him all the more. Their romance was sweet and while it didn't take front seat to the story, I think that it added to the overall theme of Demi trying to figure out how to fit the separate pieces of her world into a beautiful picture.I really love the imagery one of the characters, Stella, paints (well photographs) of Demi juggling the two worlds, the deaf community and the ""hearies"" as they call those who can hear. I also bring really appreciated the innocence and love that Demi's nephews brought to the story. One line almost made me cry:""It doesn't matter if she's deaf,"" he says. ""My aunty Demi can listen with her eyes and whisper with her hands.""This is beautifully written and it never felt forced.

B007XIC0UA,Kindle Store,"[16, 16]",3.0,1.0,4.8,5.0,"That's what Walt Kelly's Pogo said in the 1960s.  His educated readership got it.  He was paraphrasing Commodore Perry's famous 1813 quote from the Battle of Lake Erie, war of 1812.  Today nobody knows about Perry.  Or the War of 1812.  Or the Revolutionary War, for that matter.  And in fact, nothing much about American history, and certainly nothing heroic. And that, dear friends, is the problem.  For you victims of public school education, Perry's original was ""We have met the enemy and he is ours."" (pwned)Karpel writes that ""Obama's brand of liberalism isn't a political philosophy; it's a debilitating condition - like Parkinsonism, rheumatism, or alcoholism.""  People who believe in Obama are not very good at arguing to defend him. They are vociferous, yes. They tar any Obama opponent as a racist, sexist, homophobic, Bible thumping, gun toting primitive. They thus make an ad hominem attack on the individual as being the opposite of what they are, and avoid encountering the arguments themselves.Karpel knows the Obama community pretty well. He was a community organizer fighting for ""social justice"" in the early 1970s and an adviser to the far-left firebrand Abbie Hoffman. He worked with John Lennon during the former Beatle's involvement in American leftist politics. He then got into writing, for publications that find themselves on both the left and the right of the American political spectrum: The New Republic, New York Magazine, The New York Times, Playboy,  and The Wall Street Journal.It is doubtful that he was ever in Obama voter. In 1995, almost a generation ago, he wrote a book which anticipates the coming collapse which Obama is accelerating. That book is entitled ""The Retirement Myth: What You Must Know Now to Prosper in the Coming Meltdown of Job Security, Pension Plans, Social Security, the Stock Market, Housing Prices and More.""  You could say that he saw Obama coming.In any case, here are his 12 steps.  Reading these, you kind of know where the book is headed:Step one: we need to acknowledge that we became hooked on a political cult that, blurring the distinction between government and religion, presented a politician as a messianic figure.Step two: we need to acknowledge that instead of valuing only character, we became addicted to charisma.Step three: we need to acknowledge that instead of being grounded in fact and truth, we became addicted to ""narratives.""Step four: we need to acknowledge that no sooner did we express our resolve to put racism behind us by voting for an African-American to be president than we became addicted to an unprecedented form of bigotry: post-racism.Step five: we need to acknowledge that instead of valuing only a competent, we became addicted to elitism.Step six: we need to acknowledge that instead of striving for self-reliance, we became dependent on dependence.Step seven: we need to acknowledge that instead of accepting intractability and impossibility, we became addicted to the fantasy that every problem has a solution.Step eight: we need to acknowledge that instead of accepting our share of responsibility, we became addicted to blaming others.Step nine: we need to acknowledge that instead of facing painful truths, we became addicted to denial.Step 10: we need to embrace a sober alternative to the politics of addiction.Step 11: we need to make amends for having allowed ourselves to become Obama addict's by helping others to overcome their addiction to this president's belief system.Step 12: we need to support others, as well as benefit from their support, as we overcome our Obama addiction by taking steps to attain voting sobriety.Whoever wins the election in 2012, the problem will cure itself.  Europe and the US have been living on borrowed money for decades.  Borrowed time as well.  We have known all along that it cannot continue indefinitely, and the apocalypse is approaching now in a matter of months rather than years.  We have been kicking the can down the road.1.  Government long ago passed the point of being able to pay its obligations by raising money through taxation.  It had to borrow.2.  About 2008 it lost the ability to pay them by borrowing on public markets, and instead borrowed from the Federal Reserve.3.  Now, the government does not have the ability to redeem short-term borrowings from the Fed, so it has swapped short for long term debt, operation TWIST.Each action they take presumes some magical source of income in the distant future.  That would take favorable demographics - more workers.  Actually the birthrate is stagnant.  It would require higher productivity.  Actually, our population gets dumber and less productive by the year.  It would require innovation.  Actually, the government stifles innovation.  It would require investment.  Actually, increasing amounts of capital are lying idle or leaving the country.  Capital is especially abandoning places like California, where things are worst.Moreover, everything they are doing increases expenditures in the future.  Adding more people to Social Security disability.  Signing up for unbounded obligations through Medicare.  Introducing Obamacare.  Extending jobless benefits, even as people are not going back to work.  Starting and continuing wars.  Spending vast amounts on schools to ""eliminate the black-white test score gap.""  Adding employees to the bureaucracy.When world governments embarked on their regimes of fiat money, now some 80 years ago for the US, they accepted the obligation to put the ""full faith and credit"" of the government behind their currency.  In other words, the promises of politicians.  We should have known.  Many did know and spoke out at the time, but the voices of the prudent are always drowned, eventually, in a democracy.  Our people have demanded more government payments and services than we can pay for.  ""They sow the wind, and reap the whirlwind.""  That's today's voter.Obama voters especially, but even most Republicans, cannot come to grips with the fact that we cannot continue indefinitely to live beyond our means.  Ryan knows the truth, and knows enough to keep from saying it.  Romney probably does as well.  Obama's genius is in his naivety.  He doesn't even know the truth, so he doesn't run the risk of saying anything politically incorrect.We have met the enemy, and he is us.

You can download a single copy and take it with you when you leave your hotel without a lot of bulky papers to carry around.  Did you ever try to read a paper copy of a newspaper on a plane without hitting the person next to you in the nose while turning the page?  I never did learn the ""bus fold"" or ""plane fold"" way of folding the paper while reading where you end up with a origami frog or something by the time you finish.  The Kindle is even better than that.  You can read it in a small amount of space and you don't get ink all over your hands.  And if you get interrupted and have to quit reading, the Kindle saves your place so you can go right back to where you were when you start up again.  The Kindle also removes the old issue when you get a new one unless you choose to save it.  So no taking out the trash with Kindle.The Sacramento Bee contains a lot of information about what's happening in the state's capitol and the editorials and other commentary are usually interesting as well.

I own almost every copy and always dreamed of having digital versions that were more portable, safe from dust and dampness and easier to magnify.That being said, there are a couple different ways to have a digital copy. One is Amazon's method, which is like a PDF, and the other is an App-based type, which you can use on your iPad (sorry, but I don't know if this is available for Android devices).My preferred format is Amazon's standard PDF type. The main reason being that I like to turn my iPad in portrait orientation and read my books and magazine in a larger format, just like the print version. The Amazon version will resize itself automatically and there is actually much less need to magnify stuff.The Bead & Button App won't allow this. You read in landscape mode only, and while you can magnify, in certain areas, the magnification area is constrained, which makes the experience somewhat disappointing, Also, some content requires a left-to-right swipe, while other content has a scroll icon and wants you to move up and down through it. It's awkward in that way, because the experience is not consistent across all the pages.You can, however, get a free sample with the app and see if its more to your liking.

I decided to go with a Buffalo screen protector for their reputation. Big mistake. They sent two screen protectors and BOTH had debris already on the screen before I even put them on. I couldn't see it since it was covered by the blue film. I get one on and the entire right side, the side you first take off to place the film, has all kinds of dust down the inside seam between the two sides of the film. At first I thought it was on top, but no, I take off all the film and it is on the inside.So I take it off and try again with the second one. Same thing. The entire side with the first film piece is covered in dust, even worse than the first. So now I have two useless screen protectors.I've used numerous screen protectors on phones and on tablets and this one is the worst.

Even the packaging and accessory was nice. I also hooked them to my IPOD for a day  to check out the sound on another device, and it is quite good. These come with a nice little case and three adjustable ends, allowing you to form fit these to your ears.They are inner ear headphones, inserts, and they really kill any and all sound coming from the outside. I prefer this type to most others because of the way they eliminate background sound, and the deign of this pair counters a lot of other shapes. Shaped like a small bullet, they fit down in the ear well, creating a seal I've had trouble getting with a lot of other types. This allows for a crisp sound that pumps straight in. I like the sound quality a lot, impressed with it, with music coming through nicely and voices coming through well.The way they are made is nice, too, with the cord designed to be flush instead of round, eliminating the feeling that they might get caught on something and wear away. I've had that issue with other headphones, time allowing them to be ground down or accidents rubbing them to the core, but both the material and the design should keep that from transpiring. It also makes the cord feel lighter, which is something I appreciate. White for left ear, red for right, little things like this also make things better.The microphone works great on these too. It has a simple control on the right side cord. Press it to switch over, press it again and its back to whatever you were doing. I'm sometimes bad about going from talking to folks to listening to music to letting me Kindle read books to me, and this lets me switch off tasks easily.Good quality, good product.

This pair from Dulcia fits the bill perfectly for that purpose...very compact(as you would expect), and the microphone works very well.  I have made a few calls home and my family hears me very clearly, and I also have no problem hearing them.I have also used them to listen to music and movies, and in that regard the sound is also excellent, although as a disclaimer, I am in no way what you would call an ""audiophile.""  I wish they had a noise cancellation feature, but that's not really what they were designed for.  I use a different set of headphones for air travel to block out the engine noise.  During music playback, you can click the mic button to pause the music, or double click it to skip to the next song, or triple click it to go to the previous song.If a call comes in, you can click the mic button once to take the call, or hold it a couple of seconds to decline the call.  You can also initiate a call waiting function with the mic button.  Remembering all of this will take some practice ;).I will also note that I don't quite get the part about these headphones being touted as being for the Kindle Fire HD.  They're just headphones, and they'll work the same for most any device that will accommodate a set of standard headphones such as these.BTW, don't get too excited about the included case.  It's not much, and I probably won't even use it.The biggest drawback to me regarding these headphones is the price.  As of this writing, they run $65, and there are options out there as good as these for less money.

Based on the first episode, it looks like a dandy story. Rachel Elliot and Terry Brandt are investigative journalists at a San Francisco area newspaper. They're polar opposites, with Rachel finding the dirt in any story, and Terry always looking for the silver lining in every cloud. But their different outlooks serve them well in their series of ""Both Sides Now"" stories.When their editor assigns them to investigate an old abandoned mansion rumored to be a haunted house, they learn that there's more to the story than meets the eye. A wealthy man wants to buy the property and tear down the house, while a new age spiritualist opposes the sale, saying that there is a powerful psychic energy in the house.I like the author's writing style. It's straightforward and succinct, and she ratchets up the tension and suspense gradually as the story unfolds. Her description of Rachel's experience in the old mansion at night reminded me a bit of Richard Matheson's classic Hell House. Rachel and Terry are finely drawn characters, with their differences of opinion making for some great witty banter between them. As the story develops, however, it's revealed that Rachel is actually a very troubled young lady, and the haunted house assignment may be too traumatic for her.As the first episode ends, there are several issues and mysteries to be resolved:*  Why does Peter Cameron, a rich, very eligible bachelor, really want the old mansion, and why was he suddenly attracted to Rachel?*  What secrets does the old Taylor mansion hold? Is it really haunted?* Is the new age spiritualist Crystal Constellation for real, and does she really have a past connection with Rachel?* Can anyone break through Rachel's deep-seated cynicism?I'm looking forward to the next episode of the story. I don't know exactly how reviews will be done with the story coming out in segments, but it will be interesting to see how it plays out in the serial format.------------------------------------------------UPDATE (October 6, 2012): Episode 2 has been released. After her terrifying visit to the old Taylor mansion, Rachel has a strange dream, and wakes to find Terry and Crystal talking together in her kitchen. Peter shows up, and things get very heated. Through a bizarre turn of events, Rachel, Terry, and Crystal end up back at the Taylor mansion.The creep factor really ramps up in this episode. There's something in the deserted mansion that's deeply affecting everyone who enters it, but who or what is doing this remains a mystery. Meanwhile, it appears that Peter Cameron will stop at nothing to obtain the Taylor mansion for his own purposes, whatever that may be.------------------------------------------------UPDATE (November 4, 2012): Episode 3 was released on November 1. Peter and Rachel's relationship heats up, and he gives her the surprise of her life. Karen Peterson, a psychic, is introduced, and she takes Rachel, Terry, and Crystal to meet someone who can perhaps shed some light on the secrets the old Taylor mansion holds. As the episode ends, the group is closer to solving the mystery that has obsessed them, but will they risk everything to find the answers?------------------------------------------------UPDATE (December 1, 2012): Episode 4, the final episode, was released on November 29. The final episode builds to a big finish, as the secrets of the old Taylor mansion are revealed. Rachel, Terry, and Peter learn that they are intimately connected with the mansion and its violent past in ways they could never have imagined. To find peace, Rachel is called on to make the ultimate sacrifice.------------------------------------------------SUMMARY: I enjoyed Love is Strong as Death very much. As the story progressed, the suspense built steadily as it became more and more evident that Rachel had some kind of karmic connection with the mansion, even though the place had been deserted for many years before she was born. The mind-blowing climax was well worth waiting for, as all of the mansion's secrets were revealed, and Rachel's life was transformed.",691,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,Not your usual haunted house story,6,4.666666666666667,702,80.61,69.60,25.74,33.13,28.08,23.79,77.64,47.72,9.54,4.84,1.14,0.00,0.00,1.99,1.71,4.70,9.12,12.25,8.69,4.56,6.55,0.43,14.10,6.13,2.85,1.71,1.99,2.56,5.27,2.85,2.42,0.57,0.43,0.14,9.12,0.00,0.00,1.71,0.71,10.68,2.71,1.85,0.43,2.42,1.28,2.28,1.99,1.71,0.14,0.00,0.85,0.14,0.28,0.00,0.14,5.13,1.14,1.14,2.14,0.57,0.43,2.85,8.97,1.14,13.39,0.71,5.98,6.98,1.71,0.43,0.85,1.00,0.57,0.28,0.85,0.14,0.43,0.00,0.28,0.00,44.30,4.42,7.12,0.28,0.00,0.85,0.00,27.64,0.57,2.42,0.43,0.57

I was looking for something like this for a looong time, and I finally found it.Its awesome to wake up or to sleep with a fresh bible verse. I am subscribed to the amazon kindle blog.I do have a suggestion, though.  For me, the bible verses are magical; they are not just any words, these are  God's words . Reading a bible verse is like leaving this world and entering a spiritual realm, at least while I am reading the verse and trying to understand it. I really crave that detachment that comes when I  read a bible verse, again  its almost like a magical  experience, delving into its message.The problem that I have is that on the kindle all verses are outlined in the same manner: Fist the title, BIBLE VERSE OF THE DAY. Under the title, YOUR NAME and right under your name THE BIBLE VERSE. I don't mean to hurt your feelings but i think your name does not belong there. (in between Bible verse of the day and the actual verse) Its very distracting.Your name has nothing to do with the bible verse. Every time I read it it looks like this. Bible verse of the day. I think, great I cant wait! I start to drift to that spiritual state of mind. Then comes the name Michael Gallagher nice and big ( as big as the actual bible verse) My reaction is, Why do I have to acknowledge this name each time I am about to read a beautiful bible verse? Its completely inevitable. Your name is very inappropriate and distracting at that place.Now don't get me wrong. I thank you a for writing the verses; I thank you for that. But Please understand that your name (just as any other mortal's name )  just doesn't belong in there. Your name is already under the copyright title. Why insist on writing your name again each and every time. Please stop. Its very distracting and it really takes away from the experience of reading a bible verse.God knows who you are and most of your subscribers also know  that you wrote the verses BUT PLEASE stop putting your name between ""bible verse of the day "" and the actual verse. You are calling for too much attention to yourself. Your name is totally out of place. Stop calling attention to yourself! Stop reaffirming your identity ! DON'T DO THIS FOR PUBLICITY FOR THAT GOES AGAINST GOD""S WISHES. Be anonymous, and don't worry your copyright is your copyright. I hope I have made my point. Thank you but please, let me enjoy the verse and ONLY the verse! Heck your also getting paid each month already for this blog through the kindle!

Most other publishers think we should pay the same price even though they no longer have to pay for printing or delivery of the paper versions, so thanks for being honest, 2600, and not just pocketing the extra money for yourselves.  2600 will be the only magazine I'll ever subscribe to on my Kindle, which should tell you how awesome they are.",152,A3EFPXZUK73XP2,2600 in my Pants,4,5.0,147,46.38,29.30,46.05,91.78,24.50,17.69,86.39,55.10,13.61,9.52,4.76,0.68,1.36,0.00,2.72,4.08,7.48,11.56,10.20,7.48,6.80,2.72,17.01,6.80,4.08,1.36,4.76,2.72,5.44,4.76,0.68,0.00,0.00,0.68,5.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.33,2.72,1.36,2.72,2.72,2.04,5.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.68,3.40,0.68,1.36,1.36,2.04,0.00,2.04,11.56,1.36,10.20,1.36,2.72,6.12,4.08,2.72,0.00,4.08,0.00,0.00,0.68,0.00,0.00,0.68,0.00,0.00,12.93,4.08,6.12,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.72,0.00,0.00

I assume most people coming to this page already know what 2600 is at its core, so I'll only briefly mention that.2600 is The Hacker Quarterly, meaning four times a year you get a nice collection of brief articles covering a wide range of hacker related topics, from computer security to telephone systems and ""hacking the human brain"" to political freedom issues, and everything in between. It's primarily user written content, so while the editors keep the quality up, the topics change drastically from issue to issue. You may find one issue fantastic cover to cover, to only skim through a few articles in the next issue. That said, if you're into technology in general it's the best periodical out there.Now, specifically to address the Kindle release, I'm very pleasantly surprised. The text transitions well as you may expect, as does the general layout, probably due to the physical size of the magazine being more inline with the Kindle's screen size than most magazines. 2600 also includes the entirety of each issue in the Kindle edition, rather than a subset of content as some other Kindle magazines do. They've also priced the Kindle subscription very reasonably, under half what you'll pay grabbing it from your local book store or even subscribing to the physical magazine.The only sore point I can bring up is the graphics. This isn't a huge problem as 2600 has never been big in that area. You'll lose the color of the front cover, telephone shots, etc., and occasionally the random logo or diagram, while readable, will lose some fidelity. I haven't seen 2600 on the Kindle for PC/iPad etc. apps, so I can't comment on their quality there. Source core is faithfully reproduced though, which is a much larger part of 2600's appeal, at least to me.In the end, 2600 has made a very smooth transition into the digital realm.

Here he's basically just a decent young guy who starts looking into a rash of local burglaries aimed at senior citizens.  One of the burglaries, you see, had resulted in the death of an old woman Mallory had befriended while doing some volunteer work, priming Mallory's interest in bringing the burglars (and now killers) to justice.In my re-visit to the book, it was interesting to now notice that themes and interests that figure strongly into Collins' later work initially poked their heads up in small ways in this early series.  For example, the world of the small-town antiques and collectibles business- the prime element of Collins and his wife's later ""Trash 'N Treasures"" mystery series- is a modest but crucial element of ""The Baby Blue Rip-Off"".  The title- at least in part- refers to some valuable collectible plates.Anyway, this quick, entertaining read doesn't need a long review, so I'll just finish by saying that the book presents familiar mystery-novel elements (the gruff cop who doesn't want the brash young guy to get involved, the pretty blonde who maybe shouldn't be completely trusted, etc.) in fresh, involving ways.  I really enjoyed reading this book again after many years and will continue right into the next four installments.",267,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,The welcome return of a great small-town mystery,8,4.277777777777778,272,85.78,62.96,47.25,94.01,38.86,23.53,80.88,43.01,6.99,2.57,1.10,0.00,0.37,0.74,0.37,4.41,7.72,12.50,6.25,6.25,4.78,1.47,11.40,6.25,1.47,1.10,1.10,3.31,5.88,5.15,0.74,0.00,0.74,0.00,6.99,1.10,0.74,0.74,1.47,8.09,1.10,0.37,1.10,3.68,0.37,1.47,2.21,1.84,0.37,0.00,0.74,0.74,0.37,0.00,0.00,6.25,0.37,0.74,3.68,1.10,0.37,1.47,7.72,0.74,18.75,0.74,9.56,8.82,4.41,2.57,0.00,0.74,0.00,1.10,0.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.37,21.32,3.68,5.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.04,2.21,4.04,1.47,0.00

I discovered Kindle Nation Daily in October of this year, and now it is the first thing I read each day because it is so full of helpful information... things I would never have discovered on my own. He has so many links of helpful information on his site that I still haven't examined most of therm. After Amazon introduced the free Kindle for PC program, Stephen found a couple of essential free programs to go with it, that most of us would never know about, such as Calibre and InkMesh.I think it is almost a freebie to get all this useful information in one place for just 99 cents per month...and there is new stuff every day, that's why it's the first thing I read each day. One unexpected bonus: Last October, Stephen told us that the Kindle was soon going to go international, after spending a couple of years as a US only product. I knew how much I loved my Kindle, I though to myself that there would soon be a world-wide market of millions of potential Kindle lovers just like me, so I immediately went online and bought $10,000 worth of Amazon [AMZN] from my IRA money market retirement account at $92 per share. The next day it opened at $125 per share and is $135 per share as I write this. There's a reason for this: Amazon is one of the best companies in the world, they have great, reasonably priced products...and great customer service if you have a problem.Thanks Steve, for another great Amazon product - your blog - The Kindle Nation Daily![Disclaimer: I don't know Stephen Windwalker - except from reading his blog - and I have never met him.]",309,A39KYLOPR9QZOJ,Kindle Nation Daily - a must read for all Kindle owners...,11,5.0,312,48.13,44.91,81.06,97.19,34.67,14.74,86.86,51.60,16.99,9.94,6.41,0.96,0.64,1.60,0.32,7.05,4.81,13.46,7.37,7.69,5.77,1.60,13.78,8.65,3.53,0.64,4.49,3.53,5.77,5.45,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.41,0.00,0.32,0.32,1.28,12.82,4.49,2.88,1.60,1.92,1.92,1.28,0.32,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.64,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,6.73,3.53,1.60,0.32,1.92,0.32,2.88,9.62,1.28,17.31,1.28,6.41,9.62,4.81,0.64,0.00,4.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.27,6.09,4.81,0.96,0.00,0.00,0.32,1.60,0.00,1.92,0.00,2.56

However, it does not list the headlines, etc. for each section so you are forced to click between articles in a section rather than selecting an article directly from the sections list.  The articles themselves are laid out nicely and include clear and crisp photographs, charts, etc.Delivery (2 stars):  I have been a subscriber to the Kindle edition for 8 days now.  Of those 8 days, the paper was on my Kindle by 7 A.M. on 6 days, yesterday it did not arrive until mid-morning, and today as of the time of this posting (approx 9 AM) it had still not arrived.Review-Journal content (2 stars):  I am shocked to see a couple of reviewers here who believe the Review-Journal is a liberal newspaper.  That has not been my expierence at all.  In my opinion, the editors of the RJ are as far right as you can get.

In that sense, the Kindle edition of the Seattle Times succeeds. I found the delivery very prompt and you can't beat the convenience of getting the paper in bed on Sunday morning. I found the display on the Kindle sharper than the newsprint and easier on my eyes. It is nice not to have to wrestle with the big floppy sheets of a newspaper.

Here is a list of content I found in my print edition but not in the Kindle edition:- Maps, charts, statistics boxes. A story on home sales/prices was crippled by not having the charts to illustrate it. A map can be critical to understanding where a news event occurred.- Most of the photos and their captions.- The ""Newsline"" and ""Biz line"" columns of shorter articles. As the print edition has shrunk, sometimes important stories can only be found there.- Pacific and Parade magazines.- Sidebars showing where to find follow-up information, ticket information, addresses, etc.- Comics, puzzles.- All sorts of useful sports information, anything that is not an ""article"": league standings, box scores, batting averages, line scores, the entire page of statistics from various sports.- Sub-headlines and drop-quotes that give you a hint about whether you want to read an article.- Weekly review.- Weather.- Letters to the editor.- Movie show times.- Stock listings, charts, other economic indicators.- List of things open/closed during holiday.- A handful of miscellaneous missing local news stories.- Advertisements.

The first thing I am concerned with when purchasing any portable electronic tool is having a back up charger - preferably for both home and vehicle.  Initially, I went for theiGo Everywhere PS00252-0003 Universal Wall (AC) and Auto (DC) Charger with Retractable Cable (Charger Only, Tips Not Included)which was recommended when I purchased my Kindle 2.  However, when it arrived, I tried to purchase a tip for the Kindle 2 and there was none to be found (Kindle 1 yes!) - even the vendor didn't have one available.  One of the things that drew me to it was the shared cable.  I would only have to carry one tip (wall or car) and share a cable.  I returned the iGo - didn't satisfy my needs.  Then I purchased the Gomadic Corp. Essential Kit.When it arrived, I was PLEASANTLY surprised to see that it used detachable USB cables for each charger - vehicle and wall.  WOW! I can carry either tip (vehicle/wall) and one detachable USB cable to plug into each.  These detachable cables also let me connect my Kindle 2 to my PC for file transfers (like the original USB cable/charger that came with my Kindle 2).I now have two extra USB cables, so I can keep one at home as a back-up.  I am already using the plugs (vehicle/wall) and USB cable (separately) instead of the cable that came with my Kindle 2.  Talk about multi-use ... this product is great.  Best of all, I do a lot of traveling overseas and this lets me use one product for all my traveling.The fact that it auto-switches for foreign voltage (240) and the built in circuitry for surge protection and over charging ... makes this product a must have for anyone who does a lot of travel.One final point - since I needed both a wall and vehicle charger, this product offers both for twice the price of theAmazon Kindle 2 Replacement Power Adapter.

I agree that the multiple, duplicated stories from various Herald editions are annoying.  The only good feature is that the Kindle edition actually has more local news than the print edition, by combining Broward and Miami-Dade editions along with Neighbors.  Skimming articles is easier than with print editions.  The biggest downside is that the articles are not well organized.  There is no rhyme or reason of why an article pops up in the lead spot in each Kindle section, clearly not the most important article or one that would even warrant coverage on the print edition's front pages.  The articles appear to be randomly loaded.  The Kindle edition should have a list of headlines for each section (sort of like a front page# so the reader can pick and chose the articles he/she wants, and the ability to skim the others.  Use of graphics used in the print edition articles would be helpful, along with more photos.  The Miami Herald Kindle edition has set newspapers back several decades.  Herald editors should take a look at their own electronic edition, website, and most importantly some of the other Kindle editions #such as the NY Times) to get some pointers.  The price is way too high for such a low-quality product, and existing Herald print subscribers should be given a price break.

In any given Kindle edition, there are 2 or 3 duplicated articles, sometimes all under one section, sometimes spread out over several sections. I get done reading an article, hit next page, and am confronted with the same article under a different title causing me to question whether or not I actually hit next page.  Ex: In today's newspaper, January 11, 2010, there is two articles in the Local section: ""Miami-Dade plans to fight state's rejection of slots at MIA"" and ""Slot machines at Miami airport aren't dead yet."" While reading the headline gives you a false sense of different articles, they are the same.  I am not sure how the paper edition of the Miami Herald compares, but I find it to be a big waste of my time as the reader to read the same article over and over again.The Miami Herald is the biggest newspaper available for the Florida keys, and the city of Miami itself is a decent size, yet the Kindle edition newspaper gives on average just 30 articles to cover local, state, and world. The sports section is the biggest section on the kindle boasting an average of 50 articles between Sports Wire and Sports.  I want my newspaper to tell me news, not sports; that is what ESPN is for! A quick highlight of the sports coverage is more than sufficient.The weekend addition of the newspaper is better with special sections like Travel, Neighbors, Editorial, and Home an Design, but still lacking in content. I really wish they would incorporate at least some classified ads (on the weekends only) or some comics. I agree with the other reviewer that the local legend Dave Barry is missing, which is a real shame.The business section, when it is available, is sorely lacking with usually less than 5 articles. The Tropical Life section should really be called Arts and Entertainment.Overall, this kindle paper is sorely underused.

While it isn't perfect, it is good enough that I get what I need.That having been said; I know this isn't a review of text to voice, but it plays into my review of the Kindle version of Technology Review. The magazine itself is very good, but not great. The articles are well written and informative. Often I find them to be a little to light on detail, however. I prefer for them to delve into a subject more, rather than provide what feels more like a briefing or synopsis. The editing does leave a little to be desired due to the random hyphen that causes the speech to mispronounce words in the most peculiar ways. It would seem that using a simple spell-check program when authoring the thing would only add a couple minutes to the editing process.

The content is varied and significantly more detailed when compared to similar magazines along the lines of Popular Science and Popular Mechanics.  The formatting, however, needs serious work as some articles can be difficult to read.Examples of this are:- Stray hyphens from the original magazine formatting (i.e., ""tech-nology"" on a single line and -significant -amounts -of -words -with -hyphens -in -front -of -them, even if they're in the middle of a line)- Lines of text that reference non-existent pictures or graphics (should either be removed or reworded in proofreading if it's not possible to include the graphic)- And finally, the strangest out of all of them, there's one word per issue that will always have an umlaut over one of it's vowels.  This occurs on every incidence of that single word throughout the magazine.Additionally, when graphics are included (usually graphs and charts) they're useless.  Not because they're monochrome interpretations of a color image---no, there's a bigger problem that comes before that.  The issue is that the images are merely thumbnails...even if you click on them to make the image full screen.  Either way you have a useless image.  The thumbnails are too small, and the expanded image is a mass of indistinct pixels through which you can scry only a blurry line (or bar) graph, or pie chart.Back on the positive side, unlike the other magazines available for the Kindle, this magazine is more dependent on text than pictures. Therefore, any pictures typically are not an integral part of the article.  Plus, it's cheap.  (although, if I was picky, I'd say it should be cheaper since it's bi-monthly---Newsweek is only 24 cents more per month, and that's a weekly magazine)I'll be keeping the subscription.

To make the journey seem more like an adventure than walking 7 miles normally would, they have to go through a ""big"" forest (which, incidentally, you can't see from the village).4.

Yet, I couldn't put it down and successfully read the book in a day and immediately came back here to Amazon to download the second book in this trilogy, Vendetta. After successfully reading that book in a day I am eager for book 3 in the series.

I cancelled my subscription yesterday.  Why?  Too many reasons, but basically (1) paid Kindle edition is not as good as free web site version, (2) no pictures, (3) no comics, (4) no classifieds, (5) no sports scores, (6) believe it or not, no ads - I want to know what's on sale in the Detroit area when I am up there, (6) poor indexing of articles, (7) related groups of articles are often placed out of order, making it confusing to follow, (8) when there is a multi-item article, like news briefs from Oakland County, the items are all run together without spacing or font changes, so they are very hard to separate, and there is no indexing of such items either, (9) no weather reports, no local road construction or other local info, (10) no reader article feedback like on the web site, (11) no columnist sections, and (12) the Kindle edition is issued only once a day, instead of being re-sent more frequently during the day with updates and breaking news like the web site has.So, what does the Kindle edition offer that the web doesn't?  Outside of being downloaded on my Kindle each morning, which starts up faster than a PC, the Kindle version has no advantage at all.  And since I have to pay for it, the disadvantages totally outweigh the free web version, which of course not only has pictures, but has them in color, and even occasionally has animated editorial cartoons.  What makes it worse is that there is no mechanism whatsoever to relay feedback or problems in the Kindle edition to the Free Press editorial staff, and if you go to the Free Press web site, you can't find any evidence that they support (or even know about!) the Kindle edition of their paper.Unless you are a total diehard Freep fan, I wouldn't recommend getting this.

I am a longtime ""First Things"" reader and one of the early Kindle enthusiasts. Ever since I got my first Kindle I thought that ""First Things"" would make an excellent candidate for a periodical that is formatted for this device. ""First Things"" is foremost a journal of ideas, and the vast majority of its content is textual, thus being ideally suited for a small format of e-ink reading devices. Now that I've had the chance to read First Things on my Kindle I can safely say that my expectations have been largely met.The content of the Kindle edition more or less follows that of the print edition. One big exception is the poems: in Kindle version they are all collected in one single section instead of being placed throughout the magazine. Due to their often unorthodox meters or break structure, many of the poems don't look too good on Kindle.Reading of the articles on Kindle is a pleasure. Having the text presented on a six inch screen makes it seem much more manageable and legible in my opinion. Kindle also allows you to share your notes and highlights with others, including posting them on Facebook and Twitter. This is one of my favorite Kindle features in general, and I expect to post a generous amount of ""First Things"" content in the future.One of the best things about the Kindle edition, and one of its strongest selling points, is the price. The subscription comes to just $2 a month, which translates into $2.40 per issue over the course of the year. Single issues can be purchased for $4. All of these prices compare very favorably with the regular subscription of $40 a year. On the other hand, the print subscription to First Things on Amazon is just $20.Unfortunately, there are a few shortcomings of the Kindle edition. If you are subscribed to the print edition there is no way of either accessing the Kindle issues or converting to the Kindle-only subscription. You will have to cancel your print subscription and re-sign with the Kindle subscription again. Another big drawback of the Kindle subscription is that it doesn't let you access the exclusive First Things online content, including the past issues. This is not exclusively a problem with ""First Things"", but affects all Kindle periodicals. If you only access online content and past issues occasionally, then this may not be a major hindrance. Overall however, I am very happy with the Kindle version of ""First Things"" and will stick with it despite the few deficiencies.**** About First Things in General ****The journal ""First Things"" fills an important niche in the intellectual landscape of the ever-changing marketplace of ideas. It is, as its description states ""the journal of religion, culture, and public life."" In my humble opinion the definite article in the description is well deserved since ""First Things"" has positioned itself as the definitive journal on those three subjects and especially on their intersection and interplay. The ordering of the importance of those three subjects in the journal's description also reflects more or less accurately how prominently they are covered in the pages of the ""First Things."" The journal has gained considerable reputation for its unapologetic stance on the role of religion in public life, especially when it comes to politics. This is one of the thorniest issues that are often misunderstood: religion, just like any other ethical system, can and should inform those decisions that are relevant for the common good.The longtime editor-in-chief and the founder of the magazine was late great Father Richard John Neuhaus. He was a public intellectual par excellence and someone whose opinion and knowledge I admire a great deal. Each issue of ""First Things"" has several lengthy in-depth articles, a few shorter opinion pieces, book reviews, correspondence and poems.

During one of her many web page changes, she lamented about gaining weight and that if she had the choice, she wouldn't have had the surgery and she regretted it. What?? That is what the site is supposed to be about, right? How did she think that other people who came to look at her site for support took that? She described the food she was eating and I was appalled that she was surprised as to why she gained weight! How many of us after bypass eat Godiva chocolates and doughnuts from the local bakery or can eat it? Most of us would be puking our guts out from all the sugar! At first, I thought maybe she was joking but it was for real! My friend actually phoned me to go look at the site because she was just as disappointed that this was the kind of stuff that was posted. She hadn't had the surgery yet and went there on the advice of someone else and after she saw it, she wondered if this was gonna be how she would be a few years after surgery or maybe it doesn't really work. Her husband's blog (who also had a bypass) was linked to her page and when you clicked over to his page he complained about the same thing of gaining weight and that at least he cut down from a dozen doughnuts to 4 but didn't understand why his weight loss was not budging!

His brilliant weaving of the progress of thought through history and their resultant effects on society are worth the price of the book. From philosophy through psychology and into politics, education and spiritualism, his insights are well researched and told with narrative vivacity. Very helpful for anyone who wants a big picture understanding of why we are the way we are now as a society. I love his colorful analogies throughout like when he debunks modern man's attempt at removing God from his seat of dominion in philosophy and replacing him with ourselves as the center. He likens this to standing next to a life-sized cardboard cutout photo of a celebrity and taking a picture and presto! We think we are now in the picture with that celebrity, while really we are fools to think so.

Instead, an elitist professorate allied with a cadre of new age prophets proclaim there are no facts beyond political perspective and no reality beyond the constructs of language.  We are told that tolerance, not truth, must reign supreme. Yet it is precisely the purveyors of the religion of tolerance that are incapable of tolerating anything other than their utopian vision.  And on that utopian vision all possessing sanity must be horrified. A common theme of all utopian thinking is to view at least one segment of humanity possessing derivative value (Pol Pot, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Barbara Marx Hubbard, to name just a few). We must embrace the simple fact of history that Hitler and Stalin killed more people off the battlefield than all of the battles of World War II combined. With enough faith, however maligned, people can be led to believe, and perpetrate, anything. Thus enter new age prophet and self-appointed sage Brian Swimme, who perhaps best exemplifies new age doctrine when he wrote: &quot;The well-being of the Earth is primary. Human well-being is derivative.&quot; Chilling words indeed.  In this case, the phrase Thousand Year Reich is replaced with the phrase Well Being of The Earth. So the stage is set: environmentalism becomes a handy epistemology for eliminating from the planet all who continue to prevent the Great Harmonic Convergence.

In the 1990's, there was an outpouring of Christian prophecy books that gleefully used antisemtic and conspiratorial writings as authoritative works.  Some of these same works were even used by Nazis decades ago to justify their policies.  Does the author believe, for instance, that there is a Jewish world banking conspiracy?While the author may not have intended to do so, his writings also provide ammunition for the Christian Reconstructionists and/or the Dominionists who claim that only Christians should have a say in American government.  These are the people who would claim that there is no such thing as separation of church and state, that America was founded as a ""Christian Nation"" and that because the majority of early Americans were Christian, that the nation itself was founded to reflect that.  This, despite the fact that God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit are not even mentioned in the Constitution.  These folks want to take America back to the time of the New England Puritans or John Calvin's Geneva debacle.  Is this, then, what the author wants to bring to America?  Is the struggle against the ""Invisable Hand"" and evil spiritual forces meant to bring about a ""Christian America""?Brooke's best work--and it is noteworthy--has been in opposition to the various and sundry cults that have afflicted America and the world.  Sadly, he seems now to have (re)entered a cult himself, one that has him looking over his shoulder for the dread Illuminati, gazing at the sky for Black Helicoopters, and wondering which spirits inhabit the space under the world's collective beds.Conspiracy theory has done little other than encourage antisemitism, fear, bigotry, and hate for groups outside of the conspiracy believer's circle.  It is exclusivistic, narrow-minded, and not at all helpful in the effort to find common ground with the rest of the world.  In that sense, it is like Christian Reconstructionism.

Where Brooke misses the mark is in his explanation of how we got to this point. His attack upon the so-called New Age movement is misleading to say the least. While the impact of the new age is a fairly recent development, the impact of the ""great religions"" Judaism, Christianity, and Islam is quite ancient. In not understanding the catastrophic consequences of 20 centuries of falsehoods, blind faith, and mass murder, ""in the name of god"", Brooke fails to understand how a conspiracy for global tyranny has gone largely undetected. Only when one understands the disastrous effect of organized religion on man's ability to think and act realistically, can one understand why the world's been delivered to the doorstep of global tyranny. In the final analysis it's not new age isms that are most responsible for our dire plight, but the triumph of blind faith and lies in all their forms, over independent thought and the Truth.",173,A38I38HV4W0KO8,A Misleading Mix of Fact and Propaganda,7,2.0,174,95.62,63.49,84.19,25.77,24.86,20.69,87.36,45.40,5.17,2.87,0.00,1.15,0.00,1.15,0.57,2.30,10.92,14.94,5.75,4.02,6.32,1.15,10.92,5.75,1.72,2.87,2.30,1.72,5.75,2.87,2.87,0.00,1.72,1.15,5.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.72,14.37,5.75,4.02,0.00,1.72,1.72,1.72,1.72,1.15,0.57,0.00,1.15,0.00,1.15,0.00,0.00,8.05,1.15,1.72,4.02,1.72,1.15,2.87,9.20,0.00,20.69,1.72,11.49,7.47,2.87,0.00,0.57,0.00,4.60,0.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.52,4.02,5.75,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.57,2.30,2.87,0.00,0.00

It provides a quick, but incisive glimpse of every facet of this diabolically deceptive Cubic Zirconia.  When the epiphany occurred for me many years ago, and I suddenly saw the Big Picture of my intensive studies, I entertained the idea of writing a book that would pull together all of the seemingly disparate threads of ""The New World Order"" to illustrate for my readers the full weave of the specious utopian dream.  But shortly thereafter, I encountered Brooke's ONE WORLD and realized that I had been beaten to the punch.  That's fine; as long as the Truth has been elucidated by SOMEONE, it didn't need to be me.I can still clearly recall that night, sitting at my desk and believing that I was engaged in two separate studies: religion and politics.  And then suddenly, in a moment, it was as if the curtain on the stage was pulled back to reveal all of the props, the painted backgrounds, and the costumed players who were acting out the play called, ""The New World Order"", just as it had been penned by the unseen playwright - the prince of darkness.  I was astounded to realize that all of the different scenes actually formed acts, and that the acts formed a unified, but very dark story.  There were no independent, nor secular parts, I found - they all coalesced into a single production.  And to carry this analogy one step further: one could argue that The Holy Bible is the review written by a Critic who has seen the dress rehearsal.  He says it's a bad show, and it will close before its scheduled run is completed.  And since the Critic owns the theater, we can take His Word for it.One can separately study the different arms of the Shiva-like New World Order entity :  G. Edward Griffin's, THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND: A SECOND LOOK AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE will give you a full understanding of the money powers behind it - the muscle, the bodyguard.  Walter Martin's, THE KINGDOM OF THE CULTS goes into the spiritual forms it can assume and the sophism it employs.  David Barton's, ORIGINAL INTENT: THE COURTS, THE CONSTITUTION AND RELIGION examines the legal bulwark of the entity and the judicial means by which it seeks to undermine the foundation of the Truth that opposes it.  Or TORNADO IN A JUNKYARD by James Perloff, which unveils the pseudo-logical secular birthright that it claims and then uses to suck in those adherents who lack a spiritual bent.  And I don't propose that ONE WORLD should be read in lieu of any of those other titles, but ONE WORLD serves as an excellent overview that, like a road map, can be used to graphically perceive how these many paths converge at a predetermined ""place"" even when the traveler may have had a different destination in mind.Tal Brooke writes with great power, passion, intellect, and lucidity!  He has a creatively infused mind that can transform thoroughly researched non-fiction into a book that reads like a page-turning suspense novel.  Like me, he is an ""idea bulldog"" who once he has gotten a grasp on the target, shakes it out violently and relentlessly until every piece has come loose.  And now it can be observed and examined from every imaginable angle so that a full understanding of the machination can be obtained, and the functioning of its gears understood.  A couple of years ago I loaned my copy of ONE WORLD to a friend and later asked her if his writing reminded her of anyone she knew.  ""You!"" she answered.  She recognized the inner ""GRRRRR!"" that Brooke and I share.  In many respects, ONE WORLD is the book I would have written if Tal Brooke had not.  (Now whether I could have pulled it off nearly so successfully may be quite another matter.) A couple of his chapters that castigate what I call ""McChristians"" brought to mind an essay I wrote many years ago, which segues into another observation.....Tal Brooke is a Born Again Christian and writes pointedly from that world-view.  That's OK, because it is largely correct.  But Brooke misses the nuance on a couple of occasions when he fails to recognize the subtlety that separates the wholly deceived New Ager from the kernel of truth that does exist in some ""New Age"" teachings, and which is responsible for pulling the person with that mind-set into the arena completely.  For instance:  On page 57 he correctly identifies the ""cornerstone of the New Age movement: MAN IS GOD.""  But on page 83 he lumps in with that definition the Gnostic idea that man is a ""spark of the Divine.""  But these are NOT synonymous.  In the first, it is argued that God does not exist apart from the mind of man, whereas in the second, the ""spark"" is not substantive apart from the Divine Flame that gives it birth and meaning.  Brooke also dismisses the concept of reincarnation, with its ties to the New Age school, as being antithetical to the message of The Bible.  This is simply not so.  (See my Amazon guide, ""SO YOU'D LIKE TO...FIND REFERENCES TO REINCARNATION IN THE BIBLE"" Parts 1-5.)  The prince of darkness cannot draw people to himself by feeding them a diet comprised entirely of lies; that's too easily discerned even by the nitwit.  His genius is in mixing his leaven (a Biblical symbol for sin and evil) with the overarching truths that call naturally to the mind of man, and which the mind can enthusiastically embrace.  Not recognizing that the dough also contains the leaven that the devious cook has intended for him, the man ingests and assimilates it and afterwards, unwittingly sends his compliments to the chef.  (See Matthew 13:33 & 16:5-12)  But having recognized the devil's leaven, Brooke has chosen to run the entire meal down the garbage disposal.  I don't really have a problem with that.  For most people, erring on the side of caution is preferable to running the risk of contracting food poisoning!Like Brooke, I had to learn of the New Age evil the hard way.  He was once a personally selected disciple of the false messiah, Sai Baba of India, and followed him for 2 years.  (See his book, AVATAR OF NIGHT.)I was a misguided, third-generation student of the Edgar Cayce readings. (*Cayce was once asked by a seeker, ""Would a study of THE SECRET DOCTRINE be of benefit?""  His answer in reading #470-10 was, ""The study of any portion of same would be of benefit, but only in so far as it will enable the self to open for that which may be given in its meditation.  Commence, and then we may aid.""  THE SECRET DOCTRINE, in case you don't know, is one of the premier New Age ""bibles.""  It was channeled by the luciferian Theosophical Society-founder, Helena Blavatsky, and contains the frightening assertion that ""the Great Serpent of the Garden of Eden and the 'Lord God' are identical."" -Vol. 2; pg. 132.  You get that?  Lucifer is god!  Thanks for recommending a book containing that great truth, Ed!)Later, I spent 5 years intensely studying and practicing A COURSE IN MIRACLES.  After nagging doubts forced me to appeal to Him for the Truth, imagine my chagrin at having Jesus reveal to me in no uncertain terms that - despite the clear-cut claim of A.C.I.M. - He DID NOT dictate the Course - that it is actually a demonic deception!  Not everyone's ego can admit to being duped after investing so much time, and dedicating so much energy to a path; not everyone can go back to the drawing board despite the embarrassment.  Brooke and I both deserve credit for that much at least.I cannot concur with ONE WORLD in its totality, and a book of this nature desperately calls for an index, which unfortunately has not been provided.  Therefore I must withhold one Star from my rating, but don't think that I do not strongly suggest that you acquire, study, and take very seriously Tal Brooke's book, because I certainly do recommend it without reservation; this is one of the most important and penetrating books you could read about the times in which you live!""Imagine no possessions - I wonder if you can - No need for greed or hunger - A brotherhood of Man"", John Lennon sang in IMAGINE, a song he proudly described as ""virtually a communist manifesto.""  But when Lennon died, his estate was worth many, many millions of dollars.  For tax purposes, he owned Hereford Cows that he had never even seen.  Like all Utopia salesmen, when he denounced private property, he meant YOUR private property, not his own.  He wasn't practicing what he preached, but then they never do!In the current issue of the Phoenix New Times is a review of the book, THE SPACE BETWEEN THE STARS by Deborah Santana, wife of the famous Rock guitarist.  The article mentions that when she became pregnant in 1974, the couple's meditation guru, Sri Chinmoy advised her to seek an abortion, which she did.  This was the same Sri Chinmoy who served as the interfaith chaplain to The United Nations.  It's a shame that this guru urging the nations of the world to seek Peace, Love, Understanding, and Equality didn't urge that any of those great virtues be shown to the individual that Deborah Santana was Divinely ordained to carry in her body.  That's because there is no real truth to the Utopia that the New Age promoters pay lip service to.  These are simply hypocrites, figuratively selling their souls to demonic forces, and selling their twisted idealism to undiscerning and unsuspecting men and women.  Peace for the Earth will not come by a Rock star's manifesto, a guru's advice, or the appearance of a Maitreya.  It will come only when the Son of God returns and brings it with Him as promised.Until then, do yourself a favor and purchase ONE WORLD if you want to see how the incestuous relationship between the Media's Talking Heads, International Bankers, Secular Humanists, ""Progressive"" Educators, New Age Gurus, The United Nations, American Politicians, Secret Societies, Fabian Socialists, Darwinists, Marxists, and Technology is working in concert to construct the New Age World Order - the dark prince's inky social condition. (Even if all of these ideologues do not recognize their spiritual benefactor.)  And lest anyone be tempted to suspect that Brooke has reached conclusions that require a stretch of logic, he opens ONE WORLD with this succinct and transparent quote from Madeleine Albright's 1997 Harvard University commencement speech :  ""Today, I say that no nation in the world need be left out of the global system we are constructing.""  Do read Tal Brooke's somewhat futuristic book before it becomes merely a history book.  This Brooke will carry you, the reader, to the stormy sea of the coming New World, and then identify the sly sharks that swim in it, so that you will not make the mistake of becoming their chum.",1928,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,THIS AIN'T NO BABBLING BROOKE!,5,4.0,1876,81.82,54.05,26.42,38.06,25.01,20.84,81.18,50.85,12.31,5.54,2.08,0.16,0.75,2.19,0.37,6.77,10.34,12.58,7.41,3.09,6.02,1.87,11.83,3.73,1.92,1.39,2.24,2.03,4.10,2.40,1.71,0.43,0.53,0.11,7.36,0.21,0.11,0.59,2.35,11.03,3.09,1.01,1.33,1.65,1.76,3.25,1.65,1.07,0.32,0.21,1.12,0.32,0.43,0.21,0.37,4.74,0.80,0.91,2.24,0.85,0.37,3.20,7.30,1.12,12.31,1.39,6.02,4.74,3.25,1.60,0.11,0.75,1.65,0.05,0.11,0.05,0.00,0.05,0.00,0.00,17.80,4.53,5.92,0.53,0.27,0.11,0.48,1.23,2.24,1.60,0.75,0.16

However to me this is a publication you want to keep as a reference in case you are ever going to build that dream home. and unfortunately this probably is not going to happen if you buy this from Amazon.

You can keep more on the Kindle Fire itself, however all the Fires including the new ones do not have expandable storage.

Instead of sophistication and nuance, it turns out this is total cliched, standard establishment fluff, which you could get free by reading Yahoo News or MSNBC. The article I read was about the divergence of worldwide employment and globalization. Instead of citing the latest Austrian monetary and free-market theory or the business cycle distortions caused by central banking, this article simply claimed we need more spending on government education, ""reform"" of the tax code (instead of eliminating taxes) to make it more streamlined (more efficient at taking our money and transferring it to the CFR's corporate cronies), and ""smarter"" government policy to enhance first-world manufacturing (the problem with our economy is not too much government regulation, it's a lack of 'smart government'?).

Issues are not available on the Kindle until well after they actually come out.

Despite costing only $8 less than the digital subscription on the Foreign Affairs website, which provides full access to archives, the Kindle subscription offers no option to upgrade and get access to archives.Given that I can access the content of Foreign Affairs through other sources, the only reason for me to pay for this subscription is to get the Kindle format. However, the late delivery and inability to access archives in Kindle (or even PDF) format greatly reduces the value of the subscription.Overall, it is a good product but managed poorly; for me, the managemenent issues outweight the good product, so I give it two stars.

The list of authors for any given issue often reads like a who-is-who of the top echelons of US diplomacy - Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, and Condoleezza Rice are just some of the names that have offered their views and opinions on the pages of this journal over the years. As can be seen from these names, Foreign Affairs is a truly non-partisan journal and a wide variety of points of view are regularly presented. The main criterion of publication is that the topics are contemporaneous and relevant. Recently, however, there has been a tendency to include topics that are traditionally not considered to be a part of mainstream diplomatic and foreign policy concerns, but these topics usually account for just a fraction of the whole journal. The quality of writing and analysis is generally very high, but the articles are not technical and are geared towards informed non-experts. Sometimes these articles are indeed just a distillation of the views and opinions that could have been gathered from the pages of the press in general, but even in those cases it is useful to get a unique point of view of an actual bona fide protagonist of the great game of diplomacy. In those instances, just like in diplomatic writing in general, it is important to read between the lines.A few notes on Kindle edition. Since Foreign Affairs has a print format that closely resembles a paperback novel, it was to be expected that it would translate well into Kindle format. Indeed, from my experience thus far this has been the case. However, there are a few important caveats. The Kindle edition does not offer an easily browsable table of content. Instead, one jumps from one article to another with the help of Kindle's ""joystick."" Unlike Kindle books, this journal does not have the locations so it is not easy to see how far into any given article have you read. It also lacks bookmarking, although you can still write notes and make highlights. Also, if you have an iPhone or an iPod touch Kindle software, you will not be able to download it to those devices.The price for the Kindle Edition is reasonable. One should be aware that the $1.99 is the price of monthly subscription, and not a price per issue. This is important because Foreign Affairs is a bimonthly journal so the total price per issue is $4, which translates to about $24 per year. If you shop around you can save a few dollars on the annual subscription price, but you may decide that having Foreign Affairs delivered to you wirelessly wherever you are is a nice feature and worth a few extra bucks. Unfortunately, the Kindle subscription does not include the access to the Foreign Affairs online archives, so if you are interested in doing some long-term research you will probably be better off with the print subscription for now.",518,A36K2N527TXXJN,"Very good, but still needs some work",7,4.333333333333333,524,76.26,59.80,7.61,80.96,26.20,25.00,79.77,54.39,8.78,2.67,0.19,0.19,2.10,0.00,0.19,6.11,9.92,13.17,10.88,6.30,6.11,1.53,13.93,4.01,1.53,1.15,1.15,2.86,3.44,3.24,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.92,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.31,1.34,1.34,1.53,2.67,0.95,4.01,1.72,1.15,0.00,0.38,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.19,4.77,1.15,1.15,2.10,0.95,0.19,1.72,10.69,0.76,8.40,0.38,5.15,2.86,4.39,1.15,0.00,1.91,0.00,0.00,0.57,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.19,0.00,11.45,4.20,4.96,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.15,0.38,0.19,0.00,0.57

I read a lot of reviews saying there weren't any pictures, but they are mostly from a year ago, and the version I get with my Kindle (over Wifi every morning) in Vancouver comes with a whole bunch of pictures. One for most articles. I don't have a paper version to compare to, but really, pictures on a small screen won't compare to a large, colour, frontpage anyways. If that's what you're after, you're barking up the wrong tree.The Kindle version is NOT a physical copy. It can't be. It's not better than having the real thing and a large table, but it is definitely better when you're sitting on a bus or waiting for a doctor's appointment. The Kindle version is not as easy to flip through as a real paper, not even close. Instead, you press the ""next chapter"" button to flip to the next article. There is a clunky ""view section"" mode which displays 4 headlines on a page and the first sentence of each article. It's not a perfect solution, but it's not bad and I use it every day. Old versions of newspapers stack up in Kindle memory, not the kitchen table/floor. The Kindle version does not act as cheap wrapping paper. But seriously, enough silly comparisons, it is not going to be the exact same experience as the paper version. There are some things a physical copy is better for, and some things the electronic copy is better for.It IS the Toronto version, which I don't mind since I'm from Toronto. The description should make this very clear, and it's a shame they don't. If you are looking for another version, you are out of luck.I cancelled my paper subscription because I didn't like having so many dead trees stacked up in my living room every week, with most pages/articles unread. I thought I could just keep up with the online version. Didn't happen. I think just not having a computer at the breakfast table made all the difference. Who wants to sit at a computer keyboard eating breakfast? The Kindle version came along and saved the day.

So far, my number one complaint about the Kindle edition is that it gets delivered too late in the morning.I used to hear the thump of the hard copy of my Globe hitting my porch every morning sometime between 4:30 and 5:30AM;  it's my signal to get up and get reading.I have been disappointed this week to wake up and find that the Kindle edition of the Globe has not arrived.  It's always well after 6AM when the Kindle version comes in;  today, Saturday, it was after 7:30AM when the Saturday edition was finally available for download.  That is totally unacceptable.Get with it, Globe and Mail.  The electronic version of your newpaper should not be coming in two hours behind the print edition.Quite apart from the problem of the time of delivery, I find the presentation of content quite dry compared to the print edition.  Few photographs, no charts.  Of course it is wonderful to have the Globe so handy all day; I can read a few articles while I stand in line waiting for my decaf Americano, and a few more if I'm grabbing lunch at my desk. I am getting far more of the paper read in a day than I normally do.But that advantage comes from the Kindle itself, not from any enhancement from the Globe.The Globe itself doesn't appear to have put a great deal of effort or imagination into the Kindle edition.  The presentation is pedestrian.  It's reasonably easy to navigate by broad subject headings (eg ""Canada"", ""Toronto"" ""Business"" ""Sport"") but that's it.  If you're like me and like to read your favourite columnists first thing (Doug Saunders, Jeffrey Simpson, Laurence Martin, John Doyle) you're going to have to do a fair bit of clicking and manual searching to find them.That being said, were it not for the Kindle edition being delivered so late in the morning, I would probably keep this subscription because of the convenience of carrying it around in the amazingly small and light but eminently readable Kindle.Addendum Saturday, 16 October 2010It's after 10AM, and today's Kindle edition of the Globe and Mail has still not arrived.

Simple, first, you are strictly limited to viewing the magazine *only* on the Kindle, iPhone or iPad.  You cannot even view it on your computer like you can with nearly all other magazine publishers. This was a decision by Kalmbach not Amazon.  Second, the price is high for a digital product!  Wasn't digital content supposed to be easier to develop and publish?  Last, many magazine publishers have realistic view on the future of printing and have begun to offer subscription packages that include both the printed version as well as the digital one. As of now (2012-09-07) Kalmbach has chosen to not offer this type of subscription - maybe it will change but I doubt it!Please note that I have been a print subscriber of 'Model Railroader', 'Trains' and others from Kalmbach for over thirty (30) years. I did not reach my opinion lightly. Frankly I love my printed magazines and thought that a digital copy would be way to bring my magazine rack with me wherever I go. Sadly that didn't work out.Therefore, my suggestion is if you want 'Model Railroader', 'Trains', 'Fine Scale Modeler' or others in their selection, opt for the printed copy - you'll be glad you did.TrainsModel RailroaderFineScale ModelerP.S.

My youth is renewed like the eagle's!6  The Lord gives righteousness and justice to all who are treated unfairly.7  He revealed his character to Moses and his deeds to the people of Israel.8  The Lord is compassionate and merciful, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.9  He will not constantly accuse us, nor remain angry forever.10  He does not punish us for all our sins; he does not deal harshly with us, as we deserve.11  For his unfailing love toward those who fear him is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth.12  He has removed our sins as far from us as the east is from the west.13  The Lord is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him.14  For he knows how weak we are; he remembers we are only dust.15  Our days on earth are like grass; like wildflowers, we bloom and die.16  The wind blows, and we are gone--as though we had never been here.17  But the love of the Lord remains forever with those who fear him. His salvation extends to the children's children18  Of those who are faithful to his covenant, of those who obey his commandments!19  The Lord has made the heavens his throne; from there he rules over everything.20  Praise the Lord, you angels, you mighty ones who carry out his plans, listening for each of his commands.21  Yes, praise the Lord, you armies of angels who serve him and do his will!22  Praise the Lord, everything he has created, everything in all his kingdom.

Where else (on the Kindle) can you get such wide-ranging news and analysis, with a great selection of summaries of stories from major newspapers about currently big issues and with links to the full stories if we're interested in more.What amazed me was that if the source site for a link is not overly graphics-laden, the link works and we can read the full story and then go 'back' to the collection of articles summarized.  If a a page is too slow-loading or formatted in a way that the Kindle can't handle well, then I make an annotation to read the story online later when home, at the computer.  If the title is ""Next article"" as can happen, I can also save it as a clipping to remind myself to get the longer story.The content is varied, the writing smart, and this is lively reading on a daily basis.  I've tried a few newspapers and blogs and am constantly online with my computer, and Slate is my first choice for reading each day -- even when I had the NY Times subscription for the 2 week trial.One example: I wanted to know more about the Georgia/Russia situation, and Slate summed up articles from NY Times, WashPost, LA Times and MANY other sources while directing us to the actual articles.  It's great to have the summaries and pointers to so many articles I wouldn't even know about.  This is a sleeper, since I don't see it in the top 25.  One day's trial was all I needed to know I'd keep this one.  However, be aware that stories are kept for several days, so there is some redundancy there - but I like that too.Slate also has plenty of original articles and you can choose from Sections, which include (besides News and Politics), Arts & Life, Business & Tech, Health and Science, Sports, and also Slate on NPR.UPDATE:  If you do follow any Slate link to its full story via the Kindle edition, you'll get faster page-load speed -- on pre-Kindle 3 models -- if you set the web browser to default Basic mode rather than Advanced mode.  It won't, then, try to run javascript which you don't really want most of the time, unless it is needed to run something before you can see the page (rare) and the page content will come up faster.  Left-column material will come up first, so 'Next-Page' past that.With Kindle 3, if following a Web-link to a full article: Once you choose an article to read, you can press Menu button to select ""Article Mode"" for more comfortable readability and then when finished, press Menu & select ""Web Mode"" to get back to normal size and BACK button to get back to the Slate blog page where you were.",482,ARGPB9UWUEAN3,Excellent range of news with links to more detail,9,5.0,479,68.43,45.83,60.19,69.08,43.55,14.20,79.12,50.10,10.02,5.85,3.13,0.63,2.09,0.00,0.00,4.18,7.93,12.73,7.52,6.26,9.39,1.25,14.41,7.10,2.71,1.67,2.09,2.71,2.30,2.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.02,2.71,1.04,2.92,2.71,0.21,3.76,1.25,0.63,0.21,0.42,0.63,0.00,0.63,0.00,0.00,4.59,0.63,1.46,1.25,1.67,0.00,2.51,11.48,1.67,15.87,2.30,7.31,7.72,2.51,0.84,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,19.62,3.55,5.85,0.63,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.13,1.25,3.13,1.25,0.84

Mostly this is because I've now moved into the middle of the middle of nowhere. The nearest outlet selling the Times is a 30 minute drive away, and not in a direction I often travel. So it's great to be able to get the Times. It's true that you don't get the pictures (despite the comments of other reviewers, the images aren't there at all -- it's nothing to do with the country, since I'm in the US), but they don't make a huge difference to the experience.You get the Times, a great paper, but sadly not a great Kindle edition. I can live without the pictures (they'd be nice though). I can live with the price. I really like the navigation, which lets you 'flick' through the paper by section and browse headlines. What annoys me most often is the lacklustre conversion to kindle format -- some articles have lists or tables, and these are constantly mangled. Many articles start with the location of a report or the name of the reporter, and these aren't differentiated by any kind of formatting.And then there's the lack of the magazine. To be fair, there's a lot of the magazine that would really bloat the download if it was formatted like the paper copy, but equally, to not send the article text is shabby. The Sunday Times is/was/should always be a monster of a paper - the kindle version can be finished by mid-morning (with few distractions).In summary - I love the paper, and the articles are the same as you'd get in the paper edition, but the overall attention to detail in the formatting for kindle really lets this newspaper down. If you can easily get the paper edition, do. If, like me, you want the Times but can't find it, this is still worth getting. For what it's worth, I'll be keeping my subscription, I enjoy reading it, and every day I'll be hoping for improvements in the format.Update: For a few days now the ""front page"" has been coming with a small picture.

Astonishingly, reading The Times feels like reading a tabloid paper sprinkled sporadically with occasional real news items. I suspect the problem is that the paper edition uses fonts, placement, etc., to make it obvious which articles are important versus which articles are fluff intended to be merely humorous or quirky.  In the Kindle edition however, it is impossible to know which headline refers to a meaty article versus which headline when clicked will lead to a dumb little blurb about a pig farmer who did something interesting with or to his pig.  Due to the poor layout of this newspaper in its Kindle edition, I don't think it is sufficient to read The Times via the Kindle to be well informed.My top Kindle newspaper choices, to all of which I subscribe, are The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. I found The Times not to be in the same league as these other, truly world class papers, in large part because the other newspapers took the time and trouble to format their Kindle editions in ways that make them easy to know which articles are the ones that represent real news stories.My top Kindle newspaper choice for a non-United States subscription is the Irish Times.

All of OCTO's Kindle2 covers are great but this one adds a definitively rustic aesthetic to the space-age reading device while providing very good impact and scratch protection and without limiting port access. Also, having a stiff bifold like this makes some reading positions more comfortable to hold. Be advised, it's slightly bulky & doesn't fold back on itself, that may be a strength or a weakness depending on what you're looking for.Also, be advised this leather shows scratches and spots; that's not to say it's damaged, more like the grain of the leather show the direction of a scratch stroke (almost like suede, although the surface of this is smooth, not suede) and it will absorb moisture spots, meaning every one is unique and appearance of the surface is dynamic over time. I think it adds to the rustic, rugged look of the case; but some people might not enjoy that.

B00KR83E62,Kindle Store,"[27, 30]",3.0,0.8,4.084656084656085,5.0,"Let me make it clear that I am reviewing the Signet Classics version of Just So Stories.  The reason I say that is because the original versions of these stories contain material that would be offensive to most people today, but the worst of that has been removed from this edition.  The other advantage of this version is that it contains Kipling's own illustrations and his captions for those illustrations.  Finally, this version is also very inexpensive.These stories were told to Kipling in their original form when he was a child by his Indian nursemaids.  They are drawn from many non-Western sources, and provide good contrasts with European fairy tales.  In most cases, the stories are about animals or early human beings and their development into their modern form or capabilities.  But they are really satires on human weaknesses, with the moral showing how overcoming a weakness will usually create a strength.Here are the stories and their morals:How the Whale Got His Throat -- If you get too greedy, you will bite off more than you can chew.  By taking on less at a time, you can absorb more in total.How the Camel Got His Hump -- If you are lazy and procrastinate, you will just have to do without in the future and be less attractive in order to make up for it.  Having resources for times of scarcity is always helpful.How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin -- Being too aggressive will cause you to experience retribution from those you harm.  With more flexibility, you can be more agile.How the Leopard Got His Spots -- You have a better chance of success if you blend in, rather than trying to stand out individually too much.The Elephant's Child -- If you are too nosy, you can get into mischief.  Having a keen nose can help you sniff out and execute more opportunities.The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo -- Be careful what you wish for, you may get it.  Being boundless gives you the chance to explore more.The Beginning of the Armadillo -- Versatility is more valuable than knowing just one way to handle a situation.How the First Letter Was Written -- Miscommunication is easier to accomplish than correct communication.  Double-check to be sure the message is understood.How the Alphabet Was Made -- Choose combinations of communication that are unambiguous, or you will find yourself confusing everyone.  This story is a brilliant essay on how one might go about inventing written language.The Crab that Played with the Sea -- Consider the consequences of your actions before you act, or you may see the actions rebound against you.The Cat that Walked by Himself -- The benefits of helping others greatly improve one's own life.The Butterfly that Stamped -- Actions taken for the right reason have just consequences while actions taken for pride tend to boomerang against us.Each story contains a prose tale, followed by a brief poem.  The illustrations are explained in the caption at the end.The style of the stories includes lots of funny repetition, especially in the names of rivers and the features of the animals being described.  With each repetition, your smile will broaden until you cannot suppress a good laugh.The stories also use the term &quot;best beloved&quot; a lot.  What a delightful way to refer to the child to whom you are reading these stories!  That would be reason enough to introduce these stories to your children.  The phrase &quot;just so&quot; is used less often, but has a nice cadence as well, like a carpenter planing down a piece of wood to fit perfectly into an item being constructed.Since these &quot;pretend&quot; stories obviously are counter to the latest scientific knowledge, you will probably want to introduce the relevant science to your child, too, at some point.  Then you can ask your child why she or he thinks that Kipling made up these stories.  This will give you a chance to talk about the implications for people.  Be sure to give your child an opportunity to develop his or her own interpretations.  Those will be much more useful and memorable than any that you could provide.  Try to use questions to lead your little learner forward.See the opportunities that the proper balance provides!",727,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,A Humorous Look at How Strengths Emerge from Weaknesses!,9,5.0,720,75.82,92.75,11.36,90.21,30.00,22.22,87.36,53.47,13.06,7.92,0.42,0.14,4.86,1.67,0.83,5.14,9.03,13.75,9.44,5.14,5.56,0.28,15.14,5.28,3.61,1.81,0.56,3.47,5.83,4.86,0.97,0.14,0.42,0.00,14.31,0.00,0.14,0.28,1.53,14.72,2.50,3.89,1.39,4.03,1.53,4.03,2.08,0.56,0.69,0.28,1.11,0.42,0.28,0.14,0.28,8.06,0.83,2.64,2.64,3.06,0.69,3.06,9.58,2.08,9.86,1.67,4.72,3.75,2.08,0.42,0.00,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.14,0.00,14.86,5.56,3.06,0.14,0.83,0.00,0.28,3.75,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.83

Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907, Kipling was a prolific writer for both adults and children, but the ""Just So Stories"" continues to be regarded as one of the favorites of Kipling's work.  Unlike some of his other works, his imperialist political viewpoint is not evident, but it exhibits only his superb skill at amusing children by his writings.  This is a collection of a dozen short stories which display his remarkable ability to enchant the reader - especially children - with the written word, and makes for excellent ""bedtime"" story reading for young children.  It's not hard to see why so many readers speak of it with unrestrained enthusiasm.Yet as a Christian I could not wholeheartedly share the boundless devotion of most readers, and my own enthusiasm was more restrained.  Kipling is evidently familiar with the Bible and the Christian faith, because he makes frequent allusions to Biblical concepts and history, such as Noah's ark.  ""The Butterfly that Stamped"" even features king Solomon and the Queen of Sheba as two main characters.  Although both of Kipling's grandfathers were Methodist preachers, he abandoned his family heritage, stating ""Three generations of Wesleyan ministers ... lie behind me.""  Kipling' conscious departure from the Christian heritage is also evident in the ""Just So Stories"".  Even in ""The Butterfly that Stamped"" he presents king Solomon and the Queen of Sheba as married, something not revealed in Scripture.  Moreover, in many of his stories he presents an evolutionary approach to the creation of the world.  ""How the First Letter was Written"" features a Neolithic Cave Man, and ""The Cat that Walked by Himself"" describes the ""taming"" of a wild man, wild dog, wild horse, wild cow, and wild cat.  Judging charitably, it has to be admitted that many of his stories are presented as clearly absurd, nonsensical and fantastic.  One could hardly maintain seriously that in stories like ""How the Whale got his Throat"" and ""How the Camel got his Hump"" Kipling is trying to present an alternate creation account.  Nonetheless, Kipling does more than just present a fantastic creation account, but in the process is rather disrespectful and mocking of the real creation account, especially in ""The Crab that Played with the Sea"" which features an ""Eldest Magician"" making the world by a magic, and also ""The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo"" which features three gods.  But perhaps Kipling's true feelings toward the Bible are most clearly evident in ""How the Leopard got his Spots"", where he refers to grown-ups saying ""Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the Leopard his spots?"" - a direct quotation from Jeremiah 13:23! - and says ""I don't think even grown-ups would keep on saying such a silly thing if the Leopard and the Ethiopian hadn't done it once - do you?""  Here Kipling shows his true colours.  No amount of charity can justify Kipling speaking of the Word of God as ""a silly thing"".  It's unfortunate that the literary qualities of these stories are not matched by spiritual fervour.  Christian parents will want to be selective in which stories they read to their children.Yet the literary qualities of these stories cannot be denied.  They are probably best enjoyed when read aloud to children, and feature a charming, and warm style that is absolutely nonsensical and yet completely captivating. ""How the Alphabet was Made"" is perhaps one of the few exceptions - it is a creative concept, but is somewhat tedious and lacks the charm of the other stories.  But nearly all the other stories are delightfully told and wonderfully enjoyable in their exaggerated nonsense.  For instance, in ""How the Whale got his Throat"", Kipling introduces the reader to a man ""sitting on a raft, in the middle of the sea, with nothing on but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders.""  As in many of his stories, his use of repetition skilfully warms up a smile on your face.  Throughout the story, he repeatedly and gently admonishes the reader ""you must NOT forget the suspenders, Best Beloved"", ""Have you forgotten the suspenders?""  It seems absurd, but in the end proves to make perfect sense, because it is the suspenders that the man used to tie his raft in the whale's mouth, and that's how the whale got his throat!  Totally absurd, but frightfully funny!At the same time, Kipling uses his nonsensical style to convey fables about animals which satirize human values and vices.  For instance,  ""How the Camel Got His Hump"" is a satirical commentary on laziness and procrastination. This is the hallmark of Kipling's style in most of the stories, and it is this exemplary literary quality that has rightly gained this work the fame it deserves.  This edition also reproduces Kipling's original pen and ink drawings, complete with his delightful commentary explaining the illustration.  It's worth adding to your collection, because all readers will find something here that they can enjoy.  Even those of us with restrained enthusiasm like me, can not help speak of the ""Just So Stories"" with much enthusiasm!  They are more than Just So-So.",898,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,Restrained enthusiasm.,2,3.0,865,77.71,75.98,1.93,95.16,23.38,28.44,80.69,51.10,10.52,5.43,0.58,0.12,0.58,3.35,0.81,5.09,9.71,12.95,6.13,6.47,7.98,1.39,11.10,4.74,2.66,1.85,1.50,2.31,6.01,5.32,0.69,0.12,0.12,0.12,11.56,0.46,0.12,0.23,4.28,12.02,1.39,3.24,0.92,1.85,2.31,3.24,2.66,0.69,1.04,0.58,1.16,0.69,0.00,0.23,0.23,6.82,0.69,2.43,2.66,2.08,0.12,2.77,7.75,0.23,7.63,0.46,4.28,2.89,1.73,0.58,0.12,0.69,1.62,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.00,19.31,4.05,5.43,0.12,0.00,0.35,0.46,1.16,6.01,1.73,0.00,0.00

The price tag may have put me off at any other time, but since I was getting it with a certificate, I went for it. I read these stories cover to cover repeatedly as a little girl and took great delight in the hilarity of the answers to such questions as ""how did the leopard get his spots?"" or ""how did the camel get his hump?"" Kipling's stories are marvelously nonsensical - which makes them fit for a child's world. However, it was not until hearing them read aloud on this very set that I realized his rhyme and use of repetitive words or phrases is very similar to our modern master of children's literature: Dr. Seuss. It would not surprise me to find that Seuss took his inspiration from the works of Kipling. This is not striking to a reader, but as you listen to his words brought to life by the human voice it is hard to miss.Geoffrey Palmer, of As Time Goes By, is one of my favorite actors. His voice and interpretation of these beautiful stories enhances the experience so much that I was laughing out loud listening to him in my car. His dry sense of humor is felt in his characterizations of the cast and the lulling of his voice lends a calming, gentle, and sophisticated quality to the text.

Milne's WINNIE THE POOH and Kenneth Grahame's WIND IN THE WILLOWS.  They are fun to read to children 4-8, and even MORE fun for them to read for themselves at ages 7-11 (they're marvelous vocabulary builders --&quot;the mariner of infinite resource and sagacity&quot; &lt;grin&gt;).  My English-raised mother heard the stories when they were new and read them to me when I was a child, I read them to my own children, they read them to theirs, and I believe that same cycle has been repeated among millions of families since the  stories appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.It is my impression that today the JUST SO STORIES do not enjoy the popularity with children (and parents) that they once had. That may be because they are occasionally &quot;politically incorrect&quot; in their depiction of historical attitudes regarding race and culture.  Joel Chandler Harris's UNCLE REMUS stories and even Mark Twain's HUCKLEBERRY FINN are sometimes removed from local library shelves on the same basis.  In this reviewer's view, inattention to the works of Kipling and Harris and Twain deprives English-speaking children of some appreciation of the culture and civilization in which they live today. Worse yet, it deprives them of the fun of reading FOR fun.Rudyard Kipling, referred to by one reviewer here as &quot;not a very good writer&quot; was the first English writer to win the Nobel Prize (not the Pulitzer) for literature, in 1907.  He was staunchly pro-Empire in an era in which Great Britain not only ruled the waves, but a third of the globe -- the sun never set, it was said, on the British Empire, of which he sang in hundreds of poems and short stories and novels which also deserve reading  today.But imperial/colonialist notes are hard to hear in the JUST SO STORIES, which Kipling wrote for the amusement of a young niece.  The stories are meant for FUN, and all children deserve to have some.

Despite his reputation as a recluse during his four-year Vermont sojourn, he was genuinely fond of children.  With paternal tenderness and pride he wrote this anthology of 12 unrelated tales for the amusement and enlightenment of his oldest, American-born daughter.  A hint of their sacred relationship is revealed in  &quot;How the First Letter was Written&quot; and &quot;How the Alphabet was Made,&quot;  wherein readers savor the loving bonds between cavegirl, Taffy, and her devoted father, Tegumi.Many serious critics refuse to consider this collection of animal fables--which satirize human vices and foibles--as true literature, unworthy of adult time or mental effort to be appreciated.  Nevertheless, it takes a different arsenal of literary skills to write well for children, who demand  more action and clever dialogue; they expect to be hooked right away into whatever plot.  It takes an agile mind plus a youthful heart to hold kids' attention over thousands of words and several pages--even with illustrations by the multi-talented author.  (Seek those editions which offer the additional lure of Kipling's own pen and ink sketches.)Don't be swayed by any rhetoric you may have heard about Kipling's so-called Politics, either.  His social opinions frequently are blown out of proportion or taken out of context.  In any case they are irrelevant to the intent of his anthology. Other than a few socially-incorrect phrases, JUST SO STORIES proves an excellent chapter-by-chapter bedtime book, especially for parents under fire to answer the inevitable questions which explain why a particular animal looks or acts the way it does. The author has bravely tackled that problem--taking adults off the inevitable Why hook. Using his palette of unlimited vocabulary, Kipling creates his own imaginative, drole and delightful expressions.  Even if as adults we find his linguistic patchwork difficult to understand at times, most  children will enter the word game eagerly. JUST SO STORIES offers a cute read for all YAHOOS--those who are truly Young At Heart or Otherwise!",350,A1JTG5X4VHJV27,Written for His own Best Beloved Daughter,7,3.0,355,84.66,84.48,4.77,90.68,25.36,28.45,77.18,43.94,8.73,4.51,0.00,0.28,0.28,3.10,0.85,4.23,6.20,14.37,4.79,5.35,7.61,0.28,10.70,6.48,2.82,2.82,1.13,3.10,5.63,4.79,0.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.24,1.13,0.00,0.56,3.38,13.24,4.23,2.25,0.85,2.82,1.97,3.38,1.41,0.56,0.28,0.28,0.85,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.28,8.17,1.97,1.69,2.25,1.69,0.56,3.10,5.63,0.85,7.32,0.56,3.66,3.10,3.66,1.13,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,18.03,4.23,4.51,0.00,1.41,0.00,0.28,4.79,0.00,1.13,0.56,1.13

I was really not interested in the online version because I didn't want to be tied down to the computer to read the paper.  I was intrigued with the Kindle then found out that with a Kindle and a small monthly fee I could receive the paper.  So I ordered a Kindle 2 and within a week I canceled home delivery of the QC Times.My first download I sat down with my newspaper and marked off all the articles as I found them all on my Kindle.  The only things that I could not find were things like obituaries, horoscopes and sports scores but all news articles appeared.  The layout is good front page to back.  I since have signed up for the AP Sports Blog to get my national sports scores and standings.After my first week the Times has been on my Kindle every morning a few minutes after 6:00 A.M.  I have found that I read more of the content than what I did on paper because I am now reading more of the beginning of the articles rather than relying on the best headline on the page to grab my attention.Things I like, no more wet papers, not having to remember to turn off delivery of my paper when I am traveling as well being able to read the paper when I am, and no more advertisements.  I do miss not having the GO & DO on Thursdays and I miss opening up the sports page to find out what time or channel a sporting event is on.

Somebody needs to tell the author that reading three page chapters, each one ending in a cliffhanger that is resolved by turning the page and starting the next three page chapter, gets really, REALLY annoying after about chapter ten. The characters are interesting but the plot, which revolves around people who apparently become homicidal maniacs after consuming contaminated beef, and I say apparently because the brevity of the book-- novella, really-- and of the chapters, doesn't seem to much lend itself to a decent or very detailed explanation. The author would have been much better off to eliminate half of the artificial chapter ending cliffhangers, which only serve to chop up the narrative flow, and just tell the tale in a full, book length format.

I'm not actually a Conservative supporter, I just prefer the Telegraph for its more traditional style. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate, though very different from reading a newspaper, and you will probably find yourself spending more time reading articles you might have skimmed over with the digital edition. I've noticed minor errors in the type (often the first letter is lost from an article) which are presumably introduced in the digitisation process.The lack of the Sunday edition, and of even a basic set of images (I accept I'm not going to get the Sunday magazine) strikes me as crazy; hopefully at some point Amazon will see sense, or else Ofcom will intervene in what are presumably punitive network charges being passed on to the end user.EDIT: as of 29 Nov 2009, the Sunday edition seems to be being delivered - including the magazine(s).

Creative writing enables the reader to quickly be immersed into the story.An interesting tale of Oreny&#8217;s bid for freedom in his last days from prison. How he went about planning it. It does take awhile to get into the story though from there. The characters are enjoyable, but I felt it could do with a bit of speeding up to get to more exciting bits away from the prison.But be prepared because this story does start off in prison, so there are some scenes that are described that are unpleasant. Cade, the prison officer is not a character that is likeable at all, and I did wish I didn&#8217;t read some of the parts in the novel. I personally feel those scenes could have been left out, as I read the rest of the novel I was on edge in case more scenes appeared, which they did.Unfortunately I had to skip through some scenes.There is quite a lot of swearing as well; although it should be said that it is probably similar to what is actually said and done in prison.The prisoners seem to almost be made out to be the good guys, while the prison guards are the bad guys. Although I guess in reality it is probably true. Which is what I&#8217;m guessing the author is conveying, the bad side of prison that people tend not to think about. And the need for revenge.The story moves at a more interesting pace as different locations are revealed in the outside world. Historically significant locations, and a broad range of characters that eventually interconnect with one another. These characters were enjoyable to read about.The variety of characters liven up the story, getting intimate details of their inner thoughts, their past and what exactly brings them all together. I did have some difficulty connecting with the characters, some are easily forgettable, and some you want to forget.At times I felt it could speed up, the details about the three men&#8217;s trip to unknown land and the money they seek.Mistakes are made which brings the authorities closer to them.The ending was quite dramatic and unexpected.3/5 stars",370,A3RJEQYYO5XM1,"Parts of it were great, parts were hard to read.",10,3.0,390,81.50,51.03,30.55,49.64,27.86,17.95,87.18,54.62,11.79,5.64,3.08,0.00,0.26,0.77,1.54,6.15,9.23,15.38,10.51,4.36,5.38,0.51,18.97,4.36,2.56,2.05,2.05,4.10,4.87,3.08,1.79,0.00,0.26,0.00,5.90,0.00,0.51,0.00,1.54,13.33,2.05,1.54,2.05,4.62,1.03,2.31,2.31,0.51,0.51,0.77,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.92,0.26,1.03,3.33,1.54,1.03,5.13,11.03,1.03,13.33,1.54,8.21,3.85,1.03,0.77,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,13.08,5.90,3.59,0.00,1.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.31

We get a peek into the lives of these three women on Mother's Day and a shocking event that happens that they are all tied to in some way - a life-changing event - and eventually see how the three moms are connected (think like the movie CRASH with Sandra Bullock where the characters are slightly connected).

Yes, I wish the Kindle content equaled the print content. But I'm still willing to trade some content for better access, especially since I can get it without lugging a PC around, and it's available early (REALLY early - like 3:00 AM).Besides, I imagine like most others, I tend to access financial charts and graphs using online services anyway, so I don't find myself missing these items much, if at all.Then there's the price, which for me is a lot less than buying the paper issue at a time locally.Bottom line is that I feel better informed under a wider range of circumstances with IBD on the Kindle, and while there are no doubt flaws, I think it's a reasonable solution overall.",298,A38KK0SZYEH5UD,"For me, better than the print edition",7,4.0,306,66.07,14.04,96.67,37.33,43.71,17.32,88.56,56.21,15.03,9.15,8.82,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,5.88,8.82,15.69,8.17,7.52,6.21,2.29,15.03,5.23,4.90,2.61,0.65,3.27,2.94,1.63,0.98,0.33,0.00,0.33,3.92,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.33,14.71,3.59,1.96,2.61,3.59,1.31,3.92,2.61,0.98,0.65,0.98,0.33,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,5.56,0.00,1.31,1.63,2.29,0.98,0.98,12.42,0.98,18.30,1.31,9.15,7.84,4.58,0.33,0.33,1.63,0.00,0.00,0.98,0.00,0.00,0.65,0.00,0.33,16.99,4.25,5.23,0.33,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.98,0.65,3.92,1.31,0.00

The  first reason was the very high cost of the subscription.The second was the extreme right-wing opinions expressed on the editorial pages.  Their editorials make Rush Limbaugh sound like a liberal.  For all the complaining that they do about Bill Clinton, you might not realize that he has been out of office for seven years.  They were so offended at Jimmy Carter's comment that George Bush was our nation's worst President that they printed a two-week series explaining why  Jimmy Carter was the worst.  Since the editorial section takes up two full pages near the middle of the printed edition it is difficult for me to simply turn past it without at least glancing at the headlines and becoming angry.Fortunately the Kindle edition is not laid out in the same manner as the print edition.

I have never read a major newspaper with a better investigative reporting team than this newspaper.  Through the years I have been a regular reader of the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Financial Times, The Washington Post, The Globe and Mail(Canada's major newspaper out of Toronto), the Guardian(out of London,UK), the Times of London(UK)and the Wall Street Journal. All of these papers do not come close to the quality and quantity of investigative journalism available daily in Investor's Business Daily (IBD).  IBD is willing to make the effort to investigate where no other major newspapers seem willing to investigate these days. Furthermore, they back up their stories, editorials and opinions with hard facts and figures and not simply hyperbole.  It has been very interesting and eye opening to have the opportunity to read IBD on a regular basis.  Anyone who really wants to know what is going on in the world today economically, politically, or in many other ways that matter, need to have a look for themselves and compare IBD to other major newspapers they may be reading now. The only people who will not appreciate Investor's Business Daily, are people who have already made up their minds about the world and just want to hear their own opinions spouted back to them.

About 10 years ago, I switched newspapers from an SF paper to the Merc to get improved South Bay coverage, Valley Tech news and of course the ads, specially the Fry's ads. Day by day, the Merc has drifted lighter and lighter in contents to a thinner paper with the ads being the best part. So as a new Kindle owner, I thought I'd try the Merc. Some days it is almost content-free and others there is some meat. The Kindle edition is lacking much of the editorial contents of the paper version. Generally, the Kindle edition delivers: Front Page news, Local News, Sports, Business/Tech and another section which varies by day of the week. A heavy day will have about 15 Front Page articles, about 10 Local News and about 10 in Business. I don't do Sports (yeah really) so I don't track it. In all honesty, I usually read all of an issue in about 5 minutes. I do like that Kindle makes navigation really quick an easy; frankly faster than finding articles in the huge paper edition. What is seriously lacking are the ads.So, bottom line, I will contine the paper edition for purposes of getting the ads (specially Fry's; if Fry's drops Merc, I drop Merc paper edition). I will continue with a Kindle subscription to quickly and efficiently get my local news. So, yes, I am happy but there is lots of room for improvements.",254,A26R4PDCZX5SOK,Got 5 minutes?

I had not read Poets & Writer's magazine before. I had seen it on magazine racks but was turned off by the poetry aspect. Being a technical author of books likeMastering the Nikon D300/D300S, I am not interested in reading about poetry. However, being that there were few choices in Kindle, I accepted the 14-day trial.  I'm glad I did!This is a solid magazine with interesting departments like: News and Trends, The Literary Life, The Practical Writer, Grants & Awards, and Resources--along with various feature articles on good literary subjects. I was impressed with the depth of the writing and the number of good solid articles.  This is not a lightweight magazine!It has articles on subjects like writers and their obsessions, why we write, self publishing, industry news, selling books online, good websites to visit, freelance advice, and writer's resources. The magazine captures well the ""feeling"" of being a writer and struggling to deal with the issues faced by want-to-be and published authors in today's market. There are articles on both poetry and general writing, though the issues I've read have more emphasis on literary writing than poetry.I am well pleased with Poets & Writers magazine and applaud them for being one of the first writers' mags to support the Kindle format.

Comrade Khrushchev has two special requests of Ike both in Southern California.  He wants to visit Disneyland and meet Marilyn Monroe as he saw the actress? film Some Like It Hot at the American National Exhibit in Moscow.Ike arranges the meeting with Miss Monroe, but vetoes Disneyland as too dangerous especially since several foreign countries want to see the Soviet dead.  His speech at the UN inflamed the Chinese Nationalists on Formosa and the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution two years earlier have angered individuals from that satellite nation.  Khrushchev arrives in Los Angeles to a rather shabby greeting until Miss Monroe gives him superstar treatment.  When she learns that a third group plans an assassination she does everything to keep the Russian bear alive  not just to prevent World War III, but because they have become friends.Though Marilyn Monroe serving as a world savior may seem implausible, readers will believe she did save Khrushchev?s life in this remarkable historical tale.  The story line flows with life in the 1950s with the threat of nuclear war hanging over everyone.  Readers who remember the ?duck and cover? exercises in school need to deny it to hide their age.  Though terrific insights into the era and Miss Monroe, BOMBSHELL belongs to the vivid full depiction of Khrushchev, who does not get enough credit for de-Stalinization and recognizing his country?s lack of nuclear parity by not raising the ante during the Cuban missile crisis.Harriet Klausner",265,AFVQZQ8PW0L,Pure delight,2,5.0,262,95.61,71.65,12.59,7.88,23.82,29.01,75.19,41.22,7.25,3.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.05,0.76,3.44,8.02,15.65,3.44,2.67,5.73,1.15,12.60,4.96,1.91,1.15,1.53,1.53,4.58,1.53,3.05,0.38,1.53,1.15,9.92,0.00,0.76,1.15,1.91,9.92,2.67,0.76,1.91,1.15,1.15,3.05,2.67,1.53,0.76,0.38,1.91,0.00,1.91,0.00,0.00,9.54,2.67,0.38,4.20,0.38,2.29,1.53,10.31,1.53,13.36,1.53,8.02,3.82,1.91,1.53,0.00,0.38,0.00,1.91,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.78,4.20,2.29,0.00,0.00,1.91,0.00,0.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00

But to date it has proven to be a disappointment.  Read the title again, where as of this date it says ""The Best Free Ebooks for Kindle, updated daily,"" and my issue is the last two words there, as it hasn't lived up to its promise.There are some good points, and the first one has to deal with formatting, and the author/editor does an excellent job of making each page readable and interesting. These are not just random product listings, but thoughtfully crafted words and paragraphs that let the reader know what to expect. But on the downside, my issue has to with the number of postings that we've been led to expect. Right there on the Product Description, it says:""This blog gives Kindle readers the chance to discover the best free ebooks. We review at least five new books every day. You can download the book directly from each post.""Taking a look at my Kindle 2 as of this date, I see the following, and I'm listing the timestamp with abbreviated titles:* February 8, 10:00 pm: Suzanne Woods Fisher's bookKeeper...* February 7, 10:00 pm:Best of TOC 2012free for Kindle for a limited time* February 6, 10:00 pm: Kaplan's bookIntro to SAT...* February 6, 12:00 am: Jim Kraus's bookLaugh-a-Day Book of Bloopers...And that's it: there are no more.There is nothing wrong with my Kindle 2.  It's reliable and I'm receiving blog updates and books a number of times here, so that's no reason. Further, I picked this up with the customary free 14 day trial period, and there was a brief flurry of activity in late December, but very little since then. Still, I liked the formatting, so I started my paid subscription on January 8, 2012, hoping that the author/editor was having some lapse or posting issues with Amazon. Sadly, that was not to be the case.  And I keep coming back to that product description where it says: ""We review at least five new books every day.""If this blog had just half the contents and links ofFree Kindle Books and Tips, then I would be pleased, because differences in editorial content can be helpful. But the numbers above speak for themselves.  There are other ""free Kindle book"" blogs out there, and if anyone has a favorite or alternative they've discovered, please feel free to leave a comment.Right now I'll leave my subscription active in hopes that things will improve.  As such I'm giving it a 3-star rating (based on readable layout), and think that is generous considering the promises made by the author. But this will be a ""dynamic"" review, where I'll keep things updated. I hope to keep my subscription active and can up my rating to four or five stars in time.  If not, then I'll just cancel and move on.Stay tuned...2/9/2012UPDATE 2/11/2012:Have revised this review downward from a 3-star (It's OK) rating to 2-stars, using Amazon's scale. Note that the blog author has changed part of the product info from ""We review at least five new books every day"" to read ""We review at many as three new books every day."" See the comments here on this review for additional and more recent info.UPDATE 2/16/2012:The author of this blog never lived up to his original statement ""The Best Free Ebooks for Kindle, updated daily,"" and even with his revision of ""We review at many as three new books every day"" the author has never lived up to that attempt... and he needs to check his words before posting even that claim.  Maybe he thinks that his feeble attempt of posting two ""reviews"" of the same book, Kaplan'sIntro to SATon February 14th will placate some, but to this reader it's not worth the time to see double-postings like this.

This made me really wonder about those articles I didn't have in depth knowledge about.  This was made even more annoying by the fact that I didn't feel any of the articles that gave short shrift to the truth needed to.  One article on invasive species thesis was that we over react to introduction of such.  Agreed.  But it looked at the introduction of such species as if the effect was linear in the number of species.  That is questionable if not flat out false.  Most have little to no effect.  A few have a large effect.  One has to question if the author didn't want to deal with the messiness of real life.  Another article argued that American culture was primarily one of free enterprise citing that 70% of American's thought that.  As far as I could tell that is mostly ascertained through a simple questionnaire.  That is horrible broken methodology.  I suspect a larger number of people in the US think people involved in pro sports should have their salary capped or that officers of private banks should have their salaries controlled.  Neither of which are part of a purely market economy.  So instead of asking the religious question ""do you believe that free markets are the best way to organize our economy, despite severe ups and downs?""

I've really really missed not having a morning paper and was debating subscribing to a different one. Then, I got the Kindle, and the answer is easy.Advantages to reading a newspaper on the Kindle:- no big piles of newsprint to recycle (this really is number one for me)- no newsprint on my fingers- it comes automatically & means not having to wait for the delivery man- no need for vacation holds - the paper goes with you- it is WAY cheaper than the print subscription or buying the newspaper from a stand, and minimally cheaper than the web-edition- once you figure it out (doable even for those of us who won't read manuals), navigation is quite simple and nice to use- no having to fish for article continuations on later pages- font & font size selectable by you- you can even read it in bed in the morning- easier to get out from under the cat (are there kindle stands?)Disadvantages:- pictorial content is awful when it's there, and it rarely is- some of the extra stuff like the crossword puzzle isn't there- for someone used to the morning paper it doesn't feel the same - the importance of this will fadeOk. Way more advantages than disadvantages. This newspaper is news-lite, so I'll be doing sample subscriptions to several newspapers to see which one I want.

I'm less than a week into it and getting ready to shut it down.My curiosity stemmed from the highly visual, full-color design USA Today features in print and how it would be rendered on a monochrome device. So while the lack of USA Today's visual appeal on the Kindle wasn't exactly surprising it's more disappointing than you might think. My exposure to USA Today is typically limited to road trips since it's often the preferred newspaper at many hotels. I enjoy seeing all the colorful images, charts, graphs, etc. They're absent from the Kindle edition and you can't help notice it on every page.How about the content itself? I never realized how much personality the Times has vs. USA Today till I compared both on the Kindle. So while the editorials from the Times shine in print or e-format, USA Today just doesn't seem to have the same level of insightful commentary, leaving me to feel USA Today loses a lot when it loses the color/imagery. I also like scanning the ""news from every state"" that appears in the print edition. I usually head to states I've lived in (Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana) and skip the rest. That's pretty easy to do in print but not so much on the Kindle. They're sorted alphabetically (just like the print version), so in order to get to Indiana I have to scroll through every state from Alabama through Illinois before I get there. Surely there's a more efficient way of presenting this sort of content in e-format!Then there's the annoying fact that USA Today is a weekday-only publication. Sure, they distribute that Friday edition with ""weekend coverage,"" but it's not the same as getting a completely new issue on Saturday and Sunday. I'm very much looking forward to reading the Sunday Times later tonight...good luck getting that feeling from a USA Today subscription. Maybe that's why Amazon offers USA Today at a slightly lower price than the Times ($11.99 vs. $13.99). IMHO, the Times is worth every bit of that additional $2/month charge.Joe WikertKindleville Blog: [...]",385,A16ZJF0NNTOEPR,I'll Stick with The New York Times,7,2.6666666666666665,397,79.79,26.44,87.69,49.19,22.06,15.87,79.60,48.11,10.08,5.54,4.79,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.25,4.53,8.56,14.61,7.05,6.80,6.55,1.51,13.10,5.04,3.78,1.51,1.26,4.03,3.78,2.52,1.26,0.00,0.25,1.01,2.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.34,2.52,1.26,0.76,3.02,2.77,2.77,3.27,2.77,0.00,0.50,0.76,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.00,4.53,0.50,1.01,1.26,1.76,0.76,1.76,11.08,1.01,18.64,1.01,7.05,10.83,1.51,0.76,0.00,0.76,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.91,6.80,3.02,0.25,0.00,0.25,0.25,1.26,1.01,4.28,1.51,2.27

I also like USA Today, and have read it at lunch nearly every work day for years.  It is an entertaining smattering of news on a variety of subjects.  However, putting the USA Today into the Kindle 2 seemed doubtful to me.  Although the Kindle 2 is a great cover to cover reader, it is not yet a great random access device, so I wondered if it would work ok for me.  I acquired the trial subscription.After a day, I was ready to give it up, and resolved not to try another newspaper.  I tried to dive into the middle of the paper and navigate to each article I wanted to read.  I was trying to read the USA Today like I would navigate a web site, and I found it difficult to keep track of where I was.  Score 0 for random access on the Kindle 2.  It would help if the main table of contents would list all the articles. In fairness, there are a lot of articles to list, and you can get a multipage list of articles in each section with the first few words.  But that is a lot to wade through.  Still better access than the paper version, but the Kindle 2 could do better than that.But a few days later, my local morning paper never arrived, and I decided to read USA Today from Kindle 2.  This time, I read it like a book, starting at the front page.  I found I could easily navigate to the beginning of each article using the 5-way controller, and stopped at the articles I wanted to read.  This method really sold the subscription to me.  This approach is exactly how I read the paper version, starting at the front and continuing to the back, and the Kindle 2 was outstanding.I thought about this a little more.  I can get the USA Today for free on the web site.  Why bother with the Kindle edition.  But a web site doesn't present each article in front of you, for you to decide to read.  You have to navigate to each one.  You can't easily tell whether you have seen or read all of the articles for the day.  I guess that is what makes the Kindle edition better than the web site.I have to add something about delivery.  I subscribed to the paper version of USA Today for a short time.  Because we have no home delivery here, most days it arrived in my afternoon mail, sometimes the next day.  Not reliable.  So I went back to purchasing it off the newsstand each day at full price.  With the Kindle 2 subscription, the paper is ALWAYS there in the morning a few seconds after turning on the device.  I don't have to find a newsstand, and the price is less.Needs sports scores, but the Kindle edition of USA Today is a good buy!",525,A3J1IBWC3N5TC9,Gave it time to grow on me,7,4.0,505,91.38,21.41,74.50,70.49,17.41,14.65,84.36,52.48,11.09,7.13,5.74,0.20,1.19,0.00,0.00,3.96,11.29,15.25,6.34,3.76,5.15,1.58,13.86,5.35,3.37,0.99,2.38,4.16,3.56,2.97,0.59,0.20,0.20,0.00,2.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.07,1.78,1.39,2.38,3.37,1.19,4.36,0.20,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,6.34,0.59,2.18,0.59,3.37,0.59,3.56,8.91,0.00,15.45,1.39,6.93,7.52,4.55,0.79,0.20,1.19,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,12.67,7.13,4.55,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.20,0.00,0.59,0.00,0.00

It is very clear that the goal of this journal is not merely to report news--it is to carefully and concisely weave a story.  I have not seen this kind of writing anywhere else.  In an era in which many news outlets strive for the most Facebook shares and Tweets, it's refreshing to read something so well-crafted.  It really is a joy to read.Second, the material is objective.  They tell it like it is--no sugarcoating, no games, nothing.

On July 22nd, however, Bawer was transformed from mere outcast into a bona-fide villain and, for many, an actual accomplice to the horrific massacre perpetrated by Anders Breivik.  Bawer's crime?  Being cited in Breivik's ""manifesto"" explicating his rationale behind his forthcoming massacre, which ostensibly cited Bawer(and other professional ""Islamophobes"") roughly two dozen times as inspiration for his monstrous act.  Naturally, being branded as an accomplice or at least inspiration to one of the worst criminals of the young century is a very serious charge.  More importantly, it is a completely unfounded, nonsensical, and simply outrageous charge, as Bawer clearly argues in this extended essay.As a preface, it must be stated that--it's embarrassing that one would even need to point this out--Bawer(as well as other ""Islam in Europe"" authors such as Bat Ye'or, Christopher Caldwell, and Melanie Phillips) has never advocated or even vaguely implied that violence is the solution to curtailing the rise of Islamism in Europe.  On the contrary, these authors are often careful to point out that by far the greatest victims of Islamic theology are MUSLIMS THEMSELVES.So even though he was cited in Breivik's manifesto(along with, Bawer shrewdly points out, other notorious villains of history such as Thomas Jefferson, George Orwell, and Charles Darwin), where exactly, in the eyes of the Left, does Bawer's culpability lie?  Their inane and intellectually lazy argument is best crystallized in an absolutely outrageous piece posted by popular blogger Andrew Sullivan shortly after the massacre.""When an entire population in your midst is the enemy within and your government is acquiescing to it and your entire civilization is thereby doomed, what does Bruce think a blue-eyed patriot like Breivik should do?  Is the leap to violence so obviously insane?  Or is it actually the only logical conclusion to the tyranny Breivik believed he faced?""Personally, I was absolutely disgusted by this piece when I read it on Sullivan's blog the very day he posted it, and sent him a letter in which I said so as well as deconstructed the elementary logical fallacies on display in his argument.  Unsurprisingly, it seems Bawer himself felt the same way, and for those not wanting to be intellectually imaginative enough to have their comfortable ""tolerant"" views of Islam in any way disturbed, Bawer does them the favor here.Principle among the fallacies of Sullivan's argument is that Breivik's crime was rational, which is manifestly untrue.  A prospective moment's sober reflection on Breivik's plan by an even reasonably sound mind would invariably yield the conclusion that his massacre is going to have the exact OPPOSITE effect he desired.  i.e Breivik wanted to stop the emergence of an ""Islamic Europe"", so he planned to massacre children being indoctrinated in the liberal orthodoxy that Islam is completely benign. The plainly obvious outcome is that once he murders these children and his manifesto is read it will only further discredit the ""Islamophobia"" movement and only further reinforce the liberal dogma that ""Islamophobia is dangerous"".  This is a logical deduction a reasonably bright adolescent could make.  That it evaded someone who had the intellectual capability to compose a 1500 page manifesto on the history of ideological movements in Europe is evidence of the manifest insanity of his act.Note I said a PROSPECTIVE reflection on Breivik's plan would yield this conclusion.  Apparently such a sober and elementary analysis of Breivik's plan completely eluded Sullivan, whose piece more or less echoes what is now orthodoxy among the liberal establishment.  The irony, of course, is rich; Following Breivik's act, as well as the attempted assassination of Gabrielle Giffords by Jared Lee Loughner, the reflexive liberal response was that those with whom the perpetrator identified(or in the case of Loughner, before even that was known) needed to take a step back and temper their rhetoric because it ostensibly inspired an act of violence.  Yet, when an act of violence as perpetrated by Nidal Hissan at Fort Hood is committed explicitly by the perpetrator in the name of Allah, any reflection on the Qu'ran, Hadith, and other Islamic literature is completely verboten, and we are instead left to grasp at the other nebulous ""root causes"" of the act.  This is rendered even more perverse and troublesome by the fact that acts like Hissan's, as opposed to those of Breivik and Loughner, are actually completely RATIONAL within an Islamic framework, specifically the Qu'ran's incessant injunction to fight the infidels.In other words, the standard liberal protocol to acts of terror is as follows1)If the perpetrator is non-Muslim, those whose works/rhetoric the terrorist has ever been exposed to(Breivik), or even had never been exposed to(as was the case with Loughner, who never even saw Palin's now infamous ""target"" image) but, with some serious mental gymnastics, could be used to justify acts of violence, bear culpability.2)If the perpetrator is Muslim, and explicitly tells us why he committed said act(i.e the Islamic literature enjoins it), the Islamic literature is actually completely unrelated to the terrorist act.As Bawer himself said in response to the reviews excoriating his book Surrender, ""We are, make no mistake, deep into Orwellian territory here"".--------------------------I would like to state for the record that I do have one minor quibble with the book and that is the treatment of Guantonomo and Abu Gharib.  While I have absolutely no problem with torture in such extreme scenarios as the classic ""ticking bomb"" scenario or in other assorted scenarios where we can be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the person tortured possesses extremely highl-valued information, it's pretty well-documented that the torture at the aforementioned institutions often veered beyond this into an almost recreational exercise.  While I emphatically agree with Bruce that this does not even come close to indicating a general moral equivalence between the United States and Al Qaeda, his dismissal is just a tad too glib for my taste, and will probably provide ammunition for his many critics to deploy against him.------------------------In response to the reviewer who complained that Bawer sounded too ""mad"", I note that there are few things more serious than being charged as an accomplice-directly or indirectly--to an absolutely horrific murder of dozens of children.  Yes, Bawer's tone, especially in response to Sullivan, is acidic, but given the moral gravity of what's being said of him, it seems entirely justified to me.I should add that although I have focused here on the media's inane and unconscionable construing of ""Islamophobic"" literature being meaningfully related to Breivik's crime and Bawer's response to it, his book is actually far more ambitious.  Namely, he provides a brief history of the ideological climate of Norway post-World War II(which is where the title is derived from) and how the response to Breivik's crime fits into that paradigm.-------------------------My own response to Sullivan-sent the day he posted his inane piece-reads as follows.Dear Andrew,you wrote:""If you buy those very arguments, as expressed by Berwick (and Geller and Spencer), what option do you really have but the fascist solutions he recommends and the neo-fascist violence he unleashed? When an entire population in your midst is the enemy within and your government is acquiescing to it and your entire civilization is thereby doomed, what does Bruce think a blue-eyed patriot like Berwick should do? Is the leap to violence so obviously insane? Or is it actually the only logical conclusion to the tyranny Berwick believed he faced?""Why don't you ask the thousands of us fierce critics of Islam who would never dream of committing such a heinous act and are condemning this violence in the strongest possible terms? Oh, here's the point where you say ""Don't you catch the irony there?  You hold all Muslims responsible for every Islamic terrorist attack!""  Here's the key distinction: Within Breivik's ideological framework, it is extremely easy to demonstrate that committing such a destructive act is completely hypocritical and counter-productive. Had I had a chance to speak with this murderous psychopath before he embarked upon his mission, I would have admonished him that a huge percentage of his victims had absolutely nothing to do with the sort of multi-cultural dogma he detested and that the biggest political fallout from his actions would be that his own terrorist attack will simply provide rhetorical ammunition for apologists for Islam in the future(""Christians do it, too!"") What possible rational counter-argument could he have provided?Now let us consider an Islamic terrorist-to-be.  By what argument do we engage him?  Rational arguments are of no use whatsoever; our terrorist is in possession of a Higher, Divine Truth.  Should we ask him how he can justify such a murderous act, he can happily point us to snippets of the Qu'ran within which his attack will be entirely rational.  What recourse do we have then? None.  The only ones who can demonstrate to him that he is mistaken within the context of the Qu'ran are Muslims themselves.  That is why moderate Muslims share responsibility for Islamic terrorist attacks.  It simply does not suffice to declare by fiat that any Islamic terrorist ""Wasn't a real Muslim."" If violent schools of Islamic thought are such ""perversions"" of ""true"" Islamic doctrine, why aren't moderate Muslims dedicating their energies to demonstrating to these Muslims just *why* and *how* they have perverted the ""true"" nature of Islam instead of calling us Westerners ""Islamophobic"" for being disconcerted by this nonsensical violence?My argument is not, and never will be, that terrorism is the only logical outcome of Islamic faith.  Insofar as I am not Muslim(nor of any other religious creed), I believe all schools of Islamic thought to be complete nonsense.  It is indisputable, however, that terrorism is a logical outcome of Islamic faith that is incredibly easy to rationally justify within the framework of the Qu'ran.  The same cannot be said of Breivik's ideology.  That is why there is no collective responsibility shared among Islam's critics.  To not acknowledge this is pure intellectual dishonesty.""",1714,A12CSYZGBVA0LX,"An important, urgent book.",4,5.0,1740,70.01,65.85,6.36,5.20,37.83,29.31,80.17,52.47,11.84,5.75,1.21,0.69,0.80,2.59,0.46,6.09,7.70,13.51,8.85,6.78,5.57,1.32,12.18,4.48,2.87,2.18,0.69,1.90,6.84,2.41,4.37,0.80,1.90,0.11,8.05,0.00,0.23,0.00,2.59,13.45,3.22,2.64,1.55,2.07,3.33,2.93,1.44,0.57,0.57,0.17,0.52,0.17,0.06,0.17,0.11,4.89,1.03,0.75,2.36,0.23,0.69,2.70,7.99,0.80,8.62,1.03,5.40,2.30,1.61,0.63,0.00,0.17,3.05,0.63,0.69,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.29,0.00,21.15,2.70,5.00,0.11,0.11,0.86,0.11,5.69,2.70,2.18,1.38,0.29

In order to do so, he has to determine whether the charge is true, examine the nature of Breivik's arguments and then examine the media campaign that followed.  To accomplish the first two tasks, Bawer does what most members of the media did not do, which is actually read Breivik's manifesto, and then analyze it.  He then spends the first part of the book proving, by quoting Breivik, that Breivik was not an admirer of Bawer's, and considered him too liberal and insufficiently tough on Islam, and that Breivik actually acted counter to the ideologies of the many people that he superficially cited.  He also demonstrates that almost all of the times that his name appears in Breivik's manifesto, it is in quotes by other authors who are referring to his work.  These are easily confirmed, but confirming the innocence of conservative pundits is not on the agenda, which brings us to the remainder of the book, in which Bawer analyzes the media campaign.  He does this by simply comparing statements made by the targets of the campaign with the accusations of the media.  The result is devastating.  Bawer demonstrates that the Norwegian press is using the Breivik rampage as an excuse to suppress dissent and demonize its opposition.  The media's litany of libels, slanders and vicious personal attacks on those who have written about the threat of the ongoing Jihad is nothing short of astonishing, but is sadly familiar to anyone who has followed the public relations war that the Muslim world is waging on the west.  This last brings us to Bawer's use of the term Quisling.  Vidkun Quisling was a Norwegian golden boy who became a fascist and launched a coup in order to hand Norway over to the Nazis.  During WWII, his name was synonymous with treason and treachery.  Bawer goes into the shameful history of fashionable anti-Semitism in Norway, from WWII (Norway was the only Scandinavian country that collaborated with the Nazis to deport Jews) through modern times.  Calling the current Norwegian media and governing elites Quislings is a provocative and imflamatory tactic, but it is also accurate, and that is the shame of it.",396,A1N1UN3KSXKPAE,"If You Believe in Free Speech, READ THIS BOOK",9,5.0,383,90.24,65.25,10.02,9.65,25.53,25.33,76.50,52.22,10.97,3.13,0.00,0.52,0.00,2.61,0.00,7.83,11.23,14.36,7.31,2.61,6.01,1.04,11.23,2.87,0.78,2.35,0.78,1.04,3.92,1.04,2.35,0.78,1.31,0.52,7.05,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.87,8.88,2.87,1.31,0.00,1.04,1.31,2.61,0.78,0.26,0.00,0.52,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.53,1.31,1.31,4.18,0.00,0.52,2.61,8.36,0.78,10.44,1.57,4.70,3.66,2.87,0.52,0.00,0.26,1.04,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.75,3.92,4.96,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,2.09,0.52,0.00

As you follow Shane, you start to realize things can't be what they appear.  There are a few surprises, a couple twists and turns, some entertaining characters along the way; then it gets wrapped up so neat you can't even believe what happened, you cheer, then you are sad because it ended.

It was alright, but I found it to be a bit boring. Therefore I was hesitant to buy this trilogy, even though the premise sounded very interesting. It was on sale for $0.99 for three books, though, so I decided to take a chance. I'm very glad I did, because I loved these books. They were well written, had engaging characters, had good pacing and were definitely not boring.The hero is a ghost and the heroine is a medium, both of whom are very likeable characters. The plot revolves around their efforts to find and stop a demon and the villain who released it. The secondary characters who are involved with the hero and heroine are very engaging, and their individual story lines add texture and interest to the central theme.The overall tone of the story is low key and light; there is excitement and tension, and there are dramatic events, but these books are not thrillers or suspense novels. They are exactly what they purport to be--light historical paranormal romances. The books have sweet romances and clean language, making them suitable for a general audience. If you want hot erotica, you won't find it here.For those who hate books that don't ""reveal all"" at the end, this might be an issue if you buy the books individually. Each book has a definite conclusion of the individual story lines, but the overarching story line that connects the books is not concluded until the end of the third book. Think ""Lord of the Rings""; each book almost stands alone, but you won't be totally satisfied until you read all three volumes. There is a wonderful twist at the conclusion of the third book, though, so the author ties everything up and makes the wait worthwhile.I made a point of trying to stress what these books were not, as well as what they were, in the hope that potential readers will know  exactly what to expect. Anyone who likes traditional-style historical paranormal romances will probably like these books very much, and I recommend them for that audience. These books are going in my reread pile and I will be sure to try some of the author's other books.",385,A3E5Z87YBD11NE,Loved These Books,3,5.0,390,48.50,57.13,13.42,97.19,21.67,19.23,88.72,54.87,13.85,6.41,3.08,0.00,1.28,0.00,2.05,7.44,9.23,9.49,10.00,6.15,7.95,1.79,16.15,3.59,1.03,2.31,1.54,2.31,9.74,7.44,2.31,0.77,0.51,0.51,9.23,0.00,0.00,0.51,0.00,13.59,2.56,1.28,1.28,3.85,2.31,3.85,1.79,0.77,0.51,0.26,0.77,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.26,4.87,1.54,1.03,0.77,1.03,0.51,4.10,9.23,2.56,6.15,0.77,2.82,2.56,4.87,4.36,0.00,1.03,0.51,0.26,0.77,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.51,0.00,15.64,5.64,5.64,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.00,0.77,1.54,1.28,0.00,0.26
